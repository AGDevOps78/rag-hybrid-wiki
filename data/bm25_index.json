{"documents": ["A term of office, electoral term, or parliamentary term is the length of time a person serves in a particular elected office. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to re-election. Some jurisdictions exercise term limits, setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office. == Terms of office by country == Numbers in years unless stated otherwise. Some countries where fixed-term elections are uncommon, the legislature is almost always dissolved earlier than its expiry date. \"Until removed from office\" refers to offices that do not have fixed terms; in these cases, the officeholder(s) may serve indefinitely until death, abdication, resignation, retirement, or forcible removal from office (such as impeachment). In most cases where the head of government is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the lower house if it is bicameral), unless it does not survive a vote of no confidence. == United Kingdom == Being the origin of the Westminster system, aspects of the United Kingdom's system of government are replicated in many other countries.", "In most cases where the head of government is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the lower house if it is bicameral), unless it does not survive a vote of no confidence. == United Kingdom == Being the origin of the Westminster system, aspects of the United Kingdom's system of government are replicated in many other countries. === Monarch === The monarch serves as head of state until his or her death or abdication. === House of Commons === In the United Kingdom Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following dissolution of the Parliament, a general election is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament. An individual's term may be cut short by death or resignation. An MP elected in a by-election mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing re-election at the next general election.", "Bill C-16, introduced in the 39th Parliament, provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time. As in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election. === Senate === Senators are appointed to the Canadian Senate to represent a province, territory, or group of provinces, by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the British North America Act, 1965 served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.", "Senators appointed before the passage of the British North America Act, 1965 served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate. === Provincial and Territorial Legislatures === Provincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in Ontario, MNAs in Quebec, and MHAs in Newfoundland and Labrador) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut operate using a consensus model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence. All provincial legislatures have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.", "All provincial legislatures have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date. == Netherlands == In the Netherlands the position of Minister-President (Prime Minister) is limited to four years (counted from the moment the government is officially formed) although it can be repeated indefinitely after subsequent elections. It is common for the heads of governments in the Netherlands to take up the mantle multiple times, although it's neither expected or required to do so, more often a consequence of governments breaking up internally before their official four years are over and reforming with other parties. This is how the Netherlands ended up with consequent cabinets by: 4x Willem Drees (Drees-Van Schaik I '48, Drees I '51, Drees II '52 - Drees III '56) 3x Dries van Agt (Van Agt I '77, Van Agt II '81, Van Agt III '82) 4x Jan Peter Balkenende (Balkenende I '02, Balkenende II '03, Balkenende III '06, Balkenende IV '07) 4x Mark Rutte (Rutte I '10, Rutte II '12, Rutte III '17, Rutte IV '22). == China == Between 1982 and 2018, the Constitution of China stipulated that the president, vice president, premier, vice premiers could not serve more than two consecutive terms. In March 2018, China's party-controlled National People's Congress passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, as well as enhancing the central role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi as president, now without term limit.", "In March 2018, China's party-controlled National People's Congress passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, as well as enhancing the central role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi as president, now without term limit. According to the Financial Times, Xi expressed his views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts\u2014General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC)\u2014which have no term limits. However, Xi did not say whether he intended to serve as party general secretary, CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms. == See also == Term limits in the United States Term limit Reelection Midterm election == Further reading == Alexander Baturo and Robert Elgie (eds.). 2019.

An MP elected in a by-election mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing re-election at the next general election. The Septennial Act 1715 provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the Parliament Act 1911. Prior to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the prime minister's request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in 1974), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. 2001). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years; early dissolution remained possible but under much more limited circumstances.", "2001). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years; early dissolution remained possible but under much more limited circumstances. However, the act was repealed in 2022 and replaced with the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, which restored the pre-2011 constitutional situation. Because the government and prime minister are effectively indirectly elected through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a prime minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms. === House of Lords === Hereditary peers and life peers retain membership of the House of Lords for life, though members can resign or be expelled. Lords Spiritual hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. George Carey, made Baron Carey of Clifton the day after he ceased being Archbishop of Canterbury).", "Lords Spiritual hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. George Carey, made Baron Carey of Clifton the day after he ceased being Archbishop of Canterbury). === Devolved legislatures === The devolved legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have fixed terms. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, these are five years, while in Wales the fixed term is four years. Extraordinary general elections to the devolved legislatures are held if no first minister (or, in the case of Northern Ireland, first minister and deputy first minister) is nominated within a particular period of time, or if two thirds of members of the relevant legislature vote for an extraordinary general election. === Other elected offices === Offices of local government other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years. == United States == === Federal === In the United States, the president of the United States is elected indirectly through the United States Electoral College to a four-year term, with a term limit of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1951.

The Vice President also serves four-year terms but without any term limit. U.S. Representatives serve two-year terms. U.S. Senators serve six-year terms. Federal judges have different terms in office. Article I judges; such as those that sit on the United States bankruptcy courts, United States Tax Court, and United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and certain other federal courts and other forms of adjudicative bodies serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14.", "Federal judges have different terms in office.

However, the majority of the federal judiciary, Article III judges (such as those of the Supreme Court, courts of appeal, and federal district courts), serve for life. === State and territories === The terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of state constitutions and state law. The term for state governors is four years in all states but Vermont and New Hampshire; the Vermont and New Hampshire governors serve for two years. The National Conference of State Legislatures reported in January 2007 that among state legislatures: 44 states had terms of office for the lower house of the state legislature (often termed the state House of Representatives) at two years. Five (Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and North Dakota) had terms of office at four years. (The Nebraska Legislature is an exception and has a unicameral legislature with members elected for four years, with staggered elections for half of members.) 37 states had terms of office for the upper house of the state legislature (often termed the state Senate) at four years.", "Five (Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and North Dakota) had terms of office at four years. (The Nebraska Legislature is an exception and has a unicameral legislature with members elected for four years, with staggered elections for half of members.) 37 states had terms of office for the upper house of the state legislature (often termed the state Senate) at four years. 20 states had staggered elections for half of the seats in their four-year upper houses, while eight others (Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey and Texas) were elected on a 2-4-4 schedule, depending on the proximity of the election to legislative reapportionments following the decennial census. Twelve (Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont) had terms of office at two years. Among territories of the United States: In the American Samoa Fono, members of the House serve two-year terms while members of the Senate serve six-year terms. Members of both chambers of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico have four-year terms. Members of both chambers of the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature have two-year terms. The Legislature of Guam and Legislature of the Virgin Islands are unicameral and Senators have two-year terms.", "Members of both chambers of the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature have two-year terms. The Legislature of Guam and Legislature of the Virgin Islands are unicameral and Senators have two-year terms. Members of Council of the District of Columbia serve a four-year term. == Canada == As a former British territory following the Westminster System, there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch. === Monarch === Being a Commonwealth realm, Canada shares a monarch with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 15 realms until his or her death or abdication. === Viceroys === The governor general is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the prime minister, and serves for an indefinite term, though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the lieutenant governors, who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial premier), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have commissioners, who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the governor-in-council (i.e.", "Similarly, the lieutenant governors, who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial premier), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have commissioners, who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the governor-in-council (i.e. the federal cabinet), and conventionally serve for about 5 years. === House of Commons === Similar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in by-elections during the middle of a Parliament. Under the Constitution Act, 1867, a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the 39th Parliament, provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time.", "Bittern (pl. bitterns), or nigari, is the salt solution formed when halite (table salt) precipitates from seawater or brines. Bitterns contain magnesium, calcium, and potassium ions as well as chloride, sulfate, iodide, and other ions. Bittern is commonly formed in salt ponds where the evaporation of water prompts the precipitation of halite. These salt ponds can be part of a salt-producing industrial facility, or they can be used as a waste storage location for brines produced in desalination processes. Bittern is a source of many useful salts. It is used as a natural source of Mg2+, and it can be used as a coagulant both in the production of tofu and in the treatment of industrial wastewater. == History == Bittern has been extracted for a long time, at least several centuries.", "It is used as a natural source of Mg2+, and it can be used as a coagulant both in the production of tofu and in the treatment of industrial wastewater. == History == Bittern has been extracted for a long time, at least several centuries. The Dutch chemist Petrus Jacobus Kipp (1808\u20131864) experimented with saturated solutions of bittern. The term for the solution is a modification of \"bitter\". == Uses == === Salt derivation === Bittern is a source of many salts including magnesium sulfate (epsom salt). Multiple methods exist for removing these salts from the bittern, and the method ultimately used depends on the target product. Products that would naturally precipitate from the bitterns crystallize as evaporation proceeds (e. g.", "Products that would naturally precipitate from the bitterns crystallize as evaporation proceeds (e. g. kainite). Products that do not preferentially precipitate from bitterns may precipitate through the addition of another compound or through ion exchange. Potassium-magnesium sulfate double salt, a good fertilizer, is a salt that precipitates from bitterns upon addition of methanol. Ethanol is also used, but it exhibits a preference for potassium sulfate precipitation. The solution can furthermore be used in the production of potash and potassium salts. Tartaric acid is one compound that can facilitate the precipitation of these salts.", "The solution can furthermore be used in the production of potash and potassium salts. Tartaric acid is one compound that can facilitate the precipitation of these salts. Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) can be derived from bittern. Adding an alkaline solution such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or lime will cause magnesium hydroxide to precipitate, although lime is not as effective. Slower addition of the alkaline solution results in the precipitation of larger particles that are easier to remove from solution. === Coagulation === ==== Tofu ==== Nigari is produced from seawater after first removing sodium chloride. It contains mostly magnesium chloride, smaller amounts of magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and trace amounts of other naturally occurring salts. Nigari was the first coagulant used to make tofu in Japan.", "It contains mostly magnesium chloride, smaller amounts of magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and trace amounts of other naturally occurring salts. Nigari was the first coagulant used to make tofu in Japan. It is still used today because tofu made using bittern preserves the original flavor of the soybeans used to make it. Bittern causes rapid coagulation which influences the quality of the tofu. Alternatively calcium sulfate, calcium chloride or other substances are also used. ==== Wastewater treatment ==== Bittern can be used instead of aluminum-based coagulants in the treatment of wastewater produced during the fabric-dyeing process. The wastewater pH is basic, which is favorable for the use of bittern. After the addition of bittern, precipitated magnesium hydroxide works as the coagulant to collect dye, solids, organic matter, and heavy metals from the wastewater before settling out of solution.", "The wastewater pH is basic, which is favorable for the use of bittern. After the addition of bittern, precipitated magnesium hydroxide works as the coagulant to collect dye, solids, organic matter, and heavy metals from the wastewater before settling out of solution. The sludge produced from this wastewater treatment is also easier to dispose of than sludge produced by aluminum-based coagulants because there are less restrictions surrounding the disposal of magnesium, and it may be possible to recycle the sludge as fertilizer. Bittern can also be used as a source of magnesium ions (Mg2+) for the precipitation of struvite, a useful fertilizer, from wastewater containing nitrogen and phosphorus. One source of useful wastewater is landfill leachate. Bittern is just as good as other sources of magnesium ions at removing phosphorus from wastewater streams, but it lags behind other magnesium ion sources in terms of the removal of ammonia (a nitrogen compound). === Other uses === Bittern can be used to culture Haloquadratum archaea. Haloquadratum are distinctly square-shaped and are abundant in hypersaline environments such as salt ponds.", "=== Other uses === Bittern can be used to culture Haloquadratum archaea. Haloquadratum are distinctly square-shaped and are abundant in hypersaline environments such as salt ponds. Their cultivation is necessary for understanding both their ecological function in those environments as well as their unique morphology. The presence of Haloquadratum in an environment deemed inhospitable for most life has prompted closer study of these archaea. A study has been performed exploring the use of bittern as a natural magnesium supplement used to decrease cholesterol spikes after a meal (postprandial hyperlipidemia). Due to its high salinity, bittern can also be used as a draw solution for an osmotic process that concentrates sucrose in sugarcane juice. Because forward osmosis is being used, the process is relatively energy-efficient. Epsom salt can also be taken from the bittern draw solution once it is used.", "Because forward osmosis is being used, the process is relatively energy-efficient. Epsom salt can also be taken from the bittern draw solution once it is used. This method is particularly useful in areas where sugarcane and salt production are in close proximity to avoid costs associated with movement of either the sugarcane juice or the bittern. == Environmental impact == In some jurisdictions, most bitterns are used for other production instead of being directly discarded. In other jurisdictions each tonne of salt produced can create 3+ tonnes of waste bitterns. Although bittern generally contains the same compounds as seawater, it is much more concentrated than seawater. If bittern is released directly into seawater, the ensuing salinity increase may harm marine life around the point of release. Even small increases in salinity can disrupt marine species' osmotic balances, which may result in the death of the organism in some cases.", "If bittern is released directly into seawater, the ensuing salinity increase may harm marine life around the point of release. Even small increases in salinity can disrupt marine species' osmotic balances, which may result in the death of the organism in some cases. In December 1997, 94 corpses of green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, were found at the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon (OLL) in Mexico, adjacent to the industrial operation of Exportadora de Sal S.A. (ESSA), the largest saltworks in the world. The fluoride ion F\u2212 content in bitterns was 60.5-fold more than that in seawater. The bitterns osmolality was 11,000 mosm/kg of water, whereas the turtle's plasma osmolality was about 400 mosm/kg of water. Researchers concluded that the dumping of bitterns into the ocean should be avoided. The lack of adequate disposal methods for bitterns and concerns of local commercial and recreational fishing associations about bitterns\u2019 deleterious impacts upon local fish and prawn hatchery areas led the Western Australian EPA in 2008 to recommend against the proposed 4.2 million tonne per annum Straits Salt project in The Pilbara region of WA.", "Researchers concluded that the dumping of bitterns into the ocean should be avoided.

It is argued by some to be an example of the psychological concept of groupthink. Descriptions of it and application of terminology to it, date back as early as ancient Greece in Plato's The Republic. In his political philosophy work The Republic, Plato presented the noble lie (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u03c8\u03b5\u1fe6\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, gennaion pseudos) in the fictional tale known as the myth or parable of the metals in Book III. In it, Socrates provides the origin of the three social classes who compose the republic proposed by Plato. Socrates proposes and claims that if the people believed \"this myth...[it] would have a good effect, making them more inclined to care for the state and one another.\" == In philosophy == === Plato === [Y]et God in fashioning those of you who are fitted to hold rule mingled gold in their generation, for which reason they are the most precious\u2014but in the helpers silver, and iron and brass in the farmers and other craftsmen. (...) and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust them out among the artisans or the farmers. And again, if from these there is born a son with unexpected gold or silver in his composition they shall honor such and bid them go up higher, some to the office of guardian, some to the assistanceship, alleging that there is an oracle that the state shall then be overthrown when the man of iron or brass is its guardian.", "(...) and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust them out among the artisans or the farmers.

In Republic Book III, 415a\u2013417b, Plato (or Socrates within the dialogue) seeks not merely to justify the social hierarchy through the \"noble lie\", but also to devise a means of preventing intensified hostility between classes and harmoniously binding different strata together, by ensuring that each class exchanges its shares and roles and that these are distributed in a balanced way. In Plato\u2019s Republic, the \u201cgold of the soul\u201d does not refer to an actual metal, but rather to the nobility residing within the guardian\u2019s inner nature. By contrast, the \u201cgold of the earth\u201d signifies material wealth, portrayed as a source of envy, greed, intrigue, and corruption. Accordingly, he argues that the ruling and producing classes must possess different qualifications. The ruling class, endowed with the virtues likened to \u201cgold and silver\u201d in the soul, should therefore be excluded from the economic qualification to accumulate worldly wealth. The producing class, by contrast, possesses a temperament likened to \u201cbronze\u201d and thus may form and exchange wealth and property, but must be barred from participation in politics.", "The ruling class, endowed with the virtues likened to \u201cgold and silver\u201d in the soul, should therefore be excluded from the economic qualification to accumulate worldly wealth. The producing class, by contrast, possesses a temperament likened to \u201cbronze\u201d and thus may form and exchange wealth and property, but must be barred from participation in politics. In his view, the ruling and producing classes should exchange the two types of qualifications\u2014political authority and economic power. Once these two domains are intermixed, the community\u2019s misfortune and injustice inevitably begin: But whenever they shall acquire for themselves land of their own and houses and coin, they will be house-holders and farmers instead of guardians, and will be transformed from the helpers of their fellow citizens to their enemies and masters, and so in hating and being hated, plotting and being plotted against they will pass their days fearing far more and rather the townsmen within than the foemen without \u2013 and then even then laying the course of near shipwreck for themselves and the state. Tarnopolsky argues that Plato\u2019s \"noble lie\" is not authoritarian propaganda but a self-conscious civic rhetorical device that tests and educates its audience by fostering critical suspicion toward founding myths. ==== Criticism ==== The concept of the noble lie as defined by Plato has sparked controversy among modern interpreters. Although some earlier classical scholars including Francis Cornford argued that \"noble lie\" was a mistranslation, Allan Bloom argued for a literal translation and interpretation of Plato's expression. In The Open Society and Its Enemies, Karl Popper remarks, \"It is hard to understand why those of Plato's commentators who praise him for fighting against the subversive conventionalism of the Sophists, and for establishing a spiritual naturalism ultimately based on religion, fail to censure him for making a convention, or rather an invention, the ultimate basis of religion.\" Religion for Plato is a noble lie, at least if we assume that Plato meant all of this sincerely, not cynically.", "Although some earlier classical scholars including Francis Cornford argued that \"noble lie\" was a mistranslation, Allan Bloom argued for a literal translation and interpretation of Plato's expression.

Popper finds Plato's conception of religion to have been very influential in subsequent thought. Leo Strauss noted that thinkers of the first rank, going back to Plato, had raised the problem of whether good and effective politicians could be completely truthful and still achieve the necessary ends of their society. In The City and Man, Strauss discusses the myths outlined in Plato's Republic that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it was likely acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than the accidents of birth. By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the polis. He questions whether myths are needed to give people meaning and purpose and whether they ensure a stable society in contrast to the more skeptical attitude which posits that men dedicated to the relentless examination of, in Nietzschean language, \"deadly truths\" can flourish freely, all the while concluding with an inquiry into whether there can be a limit to the political and epistemic absolutes.", "By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the polis.

It involves the use of chemical techniques, analytical approaches, and often small molecules produced through synthetic chemistry to probe, characterize, and manipulate biological processes and systems at the molecular level. Although it overlaps with biochemistry, which focuses on the chemistry of biomolecules and the regulation of biochemical pathways within and between cells, chemical biology is distinguished by its emphasis on the deliberate design and application of chemical tools to address biological questions. == History == Although considered a relatively new scientific field, the term \"chemical biology\" has been in use since the early 20th century, and has roots in scientific discovery from the early 19th century. The term 'chemical biology' can be traced back to an early appearance in a book published by Alonzo E. Taylor in 1907 titled \"On Fermentation\", and was subsequently used in John B. Leathes' 1930 article titled \"The Harveian Oration on The Birth of Chemical Biology\". However, it is unclear when the term was first used.", "Leathes' 1930 article titled \"The Harveian Oration on The Birth of Chemical Biology\". However, it is unclear when the term was first used. Friedrich W\u00f6hler's 1828 synthesis of urea is an early example of the application of synthetic chemistry to advance biology. It showed that biological compounds could be synthesized with inorganic starting materials and weakened the previous notion of vitalism, or that a 'living' source was required to produce organic compounds. W\u00f6hler's work is often considered to be instrumental in the development of organic chemistry and natural product synthesis, both of which play a large part in modern chemical biology. Friedrich Miescher's work during the late 19th century investigating the cellular contents of human leukocytes led to the discovery of 'nuclein', which would later be renamed DNA. After isolating the nuclein from the nucleus of leukocytes through protease digestion, Miescher used chemical techniques such as elemental analysis and solubility tests to determine the composition of nuclein. This work would lay the foundations for Watson and Crick's discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA.", "Click chemistry is well suited to fill this niche, since click reactions are rapid, spontaneous, selective, and high-yielding. However, the most famous \"click reaction,\" a [3+2] cycloaddition between an azide and an acyclic alkyne, is copper-catalyzed, posing a serious problem for use in vivo due to copper's toxicity. To bypass the necessity for a catalyst, Carolyn R. Bertozzi's lab introduced inherent strain into the alkyne species by using a cyclic alkyne. In particular, cyclooctyne reacts with azido-molecules with distinctive vigor. === Discovery of biomolecules through metagenomics === The advances in modern sequencing technologies in the late 1990s allowed scientists to investigate DNA of communities of organisms in their natural environments (\"eDNA\"), without culturing individual species in the lab. This metagenomic approach enabled scientists to study a wide selection of organisms that were previously not characterized due in part to an incompetent growth condition. Sources of eDNA include soils, ocean, subsurface, hot springs, hydrothermal vents, polar ice caps, hypersaline habitats, and extreme pH environments.", "This metagenomic approach enabled scientists to study a wide selection of organisms that were previously not characterized due in part to an incompetent growth condition. Sources of eDNA include soils, ocean, subsurface, hot springs, hydrothermal vents, polar ice caps, hypersaline habitats, and extreme pH environments. Of the many applications of metagenomics, researchers such as Jo Handelsman, Jon Clardy, and Robert M. Goodman, explored metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of biologically active molecules such as antibiotics. Functional or homology screening strategies have been used to identify genes that produce small bioactive molecules. Functional metagenomic studies are designed to search for specific phenotypes that are associated with molecules with specific characteristics. Homology metagenomic studies, on the other hand, are designed to examine genes to identify conserved sequences that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules. Functional metagenomic studies enable the discovery of novel genes that encode biologically active molecules.", "Homology metagenomic studies, on the other hand, are designed to examine genes to identify conserved sequences that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules. Functional metagenomic studies enable the discovery of novel genes that encode biologically active molecules. These assays include top agar overlay assays where antibiotics generate zones of growth inhibition against test microbes, and pH assays that can screen for pH change due to newly synthesized molecules using pH indicator on an agar plate. Substrate-induced gene expression screening (SIGEX), a method to screen for the expression of genes that are induced by chemical compounds, has also been used to search for genes with specific functions. Homology-based metagenomic studies have led to a fast discovery of genes that have homologous sequences as the previously known genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of biologically active molecules. As soon as the genes are sequenced, scientists can compare thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously. The advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes, thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes. These also led to the discovery of several novel proteins and small molecules.", "The advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes, thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes. These also led to the discovery of several novel proteins and small molecules. In addition, an in silico examination from the Global Ocean Metagenomic Survey found 20 new lantibiotic cyclases. === Kinases === Posttranslational modification of proteins with phosphate groups by kinases is a key regulatory step throughout all biological systems. Phosphorylation events, either phosphorylation by protein kinases or dephosphorylation by phosphatases, result in protein activation or deactivation. These events have an impact on the regulation of physiological pathways, which makes the ability to dissect and study these pathways integral to understanding the details of cellular processes. There exist a number of challenges\u2014namely the sheer size of the phosphoproteome, the fleeting nature of phosphorylation events and related physical limitations of classical biological and biochemical techniques\u2014that have limited the advancement of knowledge in this area. Through the use of small molecule modulators of protein kinases, chemical biologists have gained a better understanding of the effects of protein phosphorylation.", "There exist a number of challenges\u2014namely the sheer size of the phosphoproteome, the fleeting nature of phosphorylation events and related physical limitations of classical biological and biochemical techniques\u2014that have limited the advancement of knowledge in this area. Through the use of small molecule modulators of protein kinases, chemical biologists have gained a better understanding of the effects of protein phosphorylation. For example, nonselective and selective kinase inhibitors, such as a class of pyridinylimidazole compounds are potent inhibitors useful in the dissection of MAP kinase signaling pathways. These pyridinylimidazole compounds function by targeting the ATP binding pocket. Although this approach, as well as related approaches, with slight modifications, has proven effective in a number of cases, these compounds lack adequate specificity for more general applications. Another class of compounds, mechanism-based inhibitors, combines knowledge of the kinase enzymology with previously utilized inhibition motifs. For example, a \"bisubstrate analog\" inhibits kinase action by binding both the conserved ATP binding pocket and a protein/peptide recognition site on the specific kinase. Research groups also utilized ATP analogs as chemical probes to study kinases and identify their substrates.", "For example, a \"bisubstrate analog\" inhibits kinase action by binding both the conserved ATP binding pocket and a protein/peptide recognition site on the specific kinase. Research groups also utilized ATP analogs as chemical probes to study kinases and identify their substrates. The development of novel chemical means of incorporating phosphomimetic amino acids into proteins has provided important insight into the effects of phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation events have typically been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site (serine, threonine or tyrosine) to an amino acid, such as alanine, that cannot be phosphorylated. However, these techniques come with limitations and chemical biologists have developed improved ways of investigating protein phosphorylation. By installing phospho-serine, phospho-threonine or analogous phosphonate mimics into native proteins, researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often-unfavorable effects of mutations. Expressed protein ligation, has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either terminus. In addition, researchers have used unnatural amino acid mutagenesis at targeted sites within a peptide sequence.", "Expressed protein ligation, has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either terminus. In addition, researchers have used unnatural amino acid mutagenesis at targeted sites within a peptide sequence. Advances in chemical biology have also improved upon classical techniques of imaging kinase action. For example, the development of peptide biosensors\u2014peptides containing incorporated fluorophores improved temporal resolution of in vitro binding assays. One of the most useful techniques to study kinase action is Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). To utilize FRET for phosphorylation studies, fluorescent proteins are coupled to both a phosphoamino acid binding domain and a peptide that can be phosphorylated. Upon phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a substrate peptide, a conformational change occurs that results in a change in fluorescence. FRET has also been used in tandem with Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) or fluorescently conjugated antibodies and flow cytometry to provide quantitative results with excellent temporal and spatial resolution.", "Upon phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a substrate peptide, a conformational change occurs that results in a change in fluorescence. FRET has also been used in tandem with Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) or fluorescently conjugated antibodies and flow cytometry to provide quantitative results with excellent temporal and spatial resolution. === Biological fluorescence === Chemical biologists often study the functions of biological macromolecules using fluorescence techniques. The advantage of fluorescence versus other techniques resides in its high sensitivity, non-invasiveness, safe detection, and ability to modulate the fluorescence signal. In recent years, the discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) by Roger Y. Tsien and others, hybrid systems and quantum dots have enabled assessing protein location and function more precisely. Three main types of fluorophores are used: small organic dyes, green fluorescent proteins, and quantum dots. Small organic dyes usually are less than 1 kDa, and have been modified to increase photostability and brightness, and reduce self-quenching.", "Three main types of fluorophores are used: small organic dyes, green fluorescent proteins, and quantum dots. Small organic dyes usually are less than 1 kDa, and have been modified to increase photostability and brightness, and reduce self-quenching. Quantum dots have very sharp wavelengths, high molar absorptivity and quantum yield. Both organic dyes and quantum dyes do not have the ability to recognize the protein of interest without the aid of antibodies, hence they must use immunolabeling. Fluorescent proteins are genetically encoded and can be fused to your protein of interest. Another genetic tagging technique is the tetracysteine biarsenical system, which requires modification of the targeted sequence that includes four cysteines, which binds membrane-permeable biarsenical molecules, the green and the red dyes \"FlAsH\" and \"ReAsH\", with picomolar affinity. Both fluorescent proteins and biarsenical tetracysteine can be expressed in live cells, but present major limitations in ectopic expression and might cause a loss of function. Fluorescent techniques have been used to assess a number of protein dynamics including protein tracking, conformational changes, protein\u2013protein interactions, protein synthesis and turnover, and enzyme activity, among others.", "Both fluorescent proteins and biarsenical tetracysteine can be expressed in live cells, but present major limitations in ectopic expression and might cause a loss of function. Fluorescent techniques have been used to assess a number of protein dynamics including protein tracking, conformational changes, protein\u2013protein interactions, protein synthesis and turnover, and enzyme activity, among others. Three general approaches for measuring protein net redistribution and diffusion are single-particle tracking, correlation spectroscopy and photomarking methods. In single-particle tracking, the individual molecule must be both bright and sparse enough to be tracked from one video to the other. Correlation spectroscopy analyzes the intensity fluctuations resulting from migration of fluorescent objects into and out of a small volume at the focus of a laser. In photomarking, a fluorescent protein can be dequenched in a subcellular area with the use of intense local illumination and the fate of the marked molecule can be imaged directly. Michalet and coworkers used quantum dots for single-particle tracking using biotin-quantum dots in HeLa cells. One of the best ways to detect conformational changes in proteins is to label the protein of interest with two fluorophores within close proximity.", "After isolating the nuclein from the nucleus of leukocytes through protease digestion, Miescher used chemical techniques such as elemental analysis and solubility tests to determine the composition of nuclein. This work would lay the foundations for Watson and Crick's discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA. The rising interest in chemical biology has led to several journals dedicated to the field. Nature Chemical Biology, created in 2005, and ACS Chemical Biology, created in 2006, are two of the most well-known journals in this field, with impact factors of 14.8 and 4.0 respectively. == Nobel laureates in chemical biology == == Research areas == === Glycobiology === Glycobiology is the study of the structure and function of carbohydrates. While DNA, RNA, and proteins are encoded at the genetic level, carbohydrates are not encoded directly from the genome, and thus require different tools for their study. By applying chemical principles to glycobiology, novel methods for analyzing and synthesizing carbohydrates can be developed. For example, cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars to probe their function.", "Michalet and coworkers used quantum dots for single-particle tracking using biotin-quantum dots in HeLa cells. One of the best ways to detect conformational changes in proteins is to label the protein of interest with two fluorophores within close proximity. FRET will respond to internal conformational changes result from reorientation of one fluorophore with respect to the other. One can also use fluorescence to visualize enzyme activity, typically by using a quenched activity-based proteomics (qABP). Covalent binding of a qABP to the active site of the targeted enzyme will provide direct evidence concerning if the enzyme is responsible for the signal upon release of the quencher and regain of fluorescence. == Education in chemical biology == === Undergraduate education === Despite an increase in biological research within chemistry departments, attempts at integrating chemical biology into undergraduate curricula are lacking. For example, although the American Chemical Society (ACS) requires for foundational courses in a Chemistry Bachelor's degree to include biochemistry, no other biology-related chemistry course is required. Although a chemical biology course is often not required for an undergraduate degree in Chemistry, many universities now provide introductory chemical biology courses for their undergraduate students.", "For example, although the American Chemical Society (ACS) requires for foundational courses in a Chemistry Bachelor's degree to include biochemistry, no other biology-related chemistry course is required. Although a chemical biology course is often not required for an undergraduate degree in Chemistry, many universities now provide introductory chemical biology courses for their undergraduate students.

For example, cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars to probe their function. Carolyn Bertozzi's research group has developed methods for site-specifically reacting molecules at the surface of cells via synthetic sugars. === Combinatorial chemistry === Combinatorial chemistry involves simultaneously synthesizing a large number of related compounds for high-throughput analysis. Chemical biologists are able to use principles from combinatorial chemistry in synthesizing active drug compounds and maximizing screening efficiency. Similarly, these principles can be used in areas of agriculture and food research, specifically in the syntheses of unnatural products and in generating novel enzyme inhibitors. === Peptide synthesis === Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue-specific incorporation of \"posttranslational modifications\" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even ubiquitination. These properties are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post-translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins.", "=== Peptide synthesis === Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue-specific incorporation of \"posttranslational modifications\" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even ubiquitination. These properties are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post-translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins. Although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends, the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein. To make protein-sized polypeptide chains with the small peptide fragments made by synthesis, chemical biologists can use the process of native chemical ligation. Native chemical ligation involves the coupling of a C-terminal thioester and an N-terminal cysteine residue, ultimately resulting in formation of a \"native\" amide bond. Other strategies that have been used for the ligation of peptide fragments using the acyl transfer chemistry first introduced with native chemical ligation include expressed protein ligation, sulfurization/desulfurization techniques, and use of removable thiol auxiliaries. === Enrichment techniques for proteomics === Chemical biologists work to improve proteomics through the development of enrichment strategies, chemical affinity tags, and new probes. Samples for proteomics often contain many peptide sequences and the sequence of interest may be highly represented or of low abundance, which creates a barrier for their detection.", "=== Enrichment techniques for proteomics === Chemical biologists work to improve proteomics through the development of enrichment strategies, chemical affinity tags, and new probes. Samples for proteomics often contain many peptide sequences and the sequence of interest may be highly represented or of low abundance, which creates a barrier for their detection. Chemical biology methods can reduce sample complexity by selective enrichment using affinity chromatography. This involves targeting a peptide with a distinguishing feature like a biotin label or a post translational modification. Methods have been developed that include the use of antibodies, lectins to capture glycoproteins, and immobilized metal ions to capture phosphorylated peptides and enzyme substrates to capture select enzymes. === Enzyme probes === To investigate enzymatic activity as opposed to total protein, activity-based reagents have been developed to label the enzymatically active form of proteins (see Activity-based proteomics). For example, serine hydrolase- and cysteine protease-inhibitors have been converted to suicide inhibitors. This strategy enhances the ability to selectively analyze low abundance constituents through direct targeting.", "For example, serine hydrolase- and cysteine protease-inhibitors have been converted to suicide inhibitors. This strategy enhances the ability to selectively analyze low abundance constituents through direct targeting. Enzyme activity can also be monitored through converted substrate. Identification of enzyme substrates is a problem of significant difficulty in proteomics and is vital to the understanding of signal transduction pathways in cells. A method that has been developed uses \"analog-sensitive\" kinases to label substrates using an unnatural ATP analog, facilitating visualization and identification through a unique handle. === Employing biology === Many research programs are also focused on employing natural biomolecules to perform biological tasks or to support a new chemical method. In this regard, chemical biology researchers have shown that DNA can serve as a template for synthetic chemistry, self-assembling proteins can serve as a structural scaffold for new materials, and RNA can be evolved in vitro to produce new catalytic function. Additionally, heterobifunctional (two-sided) synthetic small molecules such as dimerizers or PROTACs bring two proteins together inside cells, which can synthetically induce important new biological functions such as targeted protein degradation.", "In this regard, chemical biology researchers have shown that DNA can serve as a template for synthetic chemistry, self-assembling proteins can serve as a structural scaffold for new materials, and RNA can be evolved in vitro to produce new catalytic function. Additionally, heterobifunctional (two-sided) synthetic small molecules such as dimerizers or PROTACs bring two proteins together inside cells, which can synthetically induce important new biological functions such as targeted protein degradation. === Directed evolution === A primary goal of protein engineering is the design of novel peptides or proteins with a desired structure and chemical activity. Because our knowledge of the relationship between primary sequence, structure, and function of proteins is limited, rational design of new proteins with engineered activities is extremely challenging. In directed evolution, repeated cycles of genetic diversification followed by a screening or selection process, can be used to mimic natural selection in the laboratory to design new proteins with a desired activity. Several methods exist for creating large libraries of sequence variants. Among the most widely used are subjecting DNA to UV radiation or chemical mutagens, error-prone PCR, degenerate codons, or recombination. Once a large library of variants is created, selection or screening techniques are used to find mutants with a desired attribute.", "Among the most widely used are subjecting DNA to UV radiation or chemical mutagens, error-prone PCR, degenerate codons, or recombination. Once a large library of variants is created, selection or screening techniques are used to find mutants with a desired attribute. Common selection/screening techniques include FACS, mRNA display, phage display, and in vitro compartmentalization. Once useful variants are found, their DNA sequence is amplified and subjected to further rounds of diversification and selection. The development of directed evolution methods was honored in 2018 with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frances Arnold for evolution of enzymes, and George Smith and Gregory Winter for phage display. === Bioorthogonal reactions === Successful labeling of a molecule of interest requires specific functionalization of that molecule to react chemospecifically with an optical probe. For a labeling experiment to be considered robust, that functionalization must minimally perturb the system. These requirements are often difficult to meet.", "For a labeling experiment to be considered robust, that functionalization must minimally perturb the system. These requirements are often difficult to meet. Many of the reactions normally available to organic chemists in the laboratory are unavailable in living systems. Water- and redox- sensitive reactions would not proceed, reagents prone to nucleophilic attack would offer no chemospecificity, and any reactions with large kinetic barriers would not find enough energy in the relatively low-heat environment of a living cell. Thus, chemists have recently developed a panel of bioorthogonal chemistry that proceed chemospecifically, despite the milieu of distracting reactive materials in vivo. The coupling of a probe to a molecule of interest must occur within a reasonably short time frame; therefore, the kinetics of the coupling reaction should be highly favorable. Click chemistry is well suited to fill this niche, since click reactions are rapid, spontaneous, selective, and high-yielding. However, the most famous \"click reaction,\" a [3+2] cycloaddition between an azide and an acyclic alkyne, is copper-catalyzed, posing a serious problem for use in vivo due to copper's toxicity.", "Mathematics is a field of study that discovers and organizes methods, theories, and theorems that are developed and proved for the needs of empirical sciences and mathematics itself. There are many areas of mathematics, which include number theory (the study of numbers), algebra (the study of formulas and related structures), geometry (the study of shapes and spaces that contain them), analysis (the study of continuous changes), and set theory (presently used as a foundation for all mathematics). Mathematics involves the description and manipulation of abstract objects that consist of either abstractions from nature or\u2014in modern mathematics\u2014purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. Mathematics uses pure reason to prove the properties of objects through proofs, which consist of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results. These results, called theorems, include previously proved theorems, axioms, and\u2014in case of abstraction from nature\u2014some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration. Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science, and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics.", "Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent of any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical applications. Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetics (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions) until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.", "This simplifies many aspects of classical geometry by unifying the treatments for intersecting and parallel lines. Affine geometry, the study of properties relative to parallelism and independent from the concept of length. Differential geometry, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using differentiable functions. Manifold theory, the study of shapes that are not necessarily embedded in a larger space. Riemannian geometry, the study of distance properties in curved spaces. Algebraic geometry, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using polynomials. Topology, the study of properties that are kept under continuous deformations. Algebraic topology, the use in topology of algebraic methods, mainly homological algebra.", "Topology, the study of properties that are kept under continuous deformations. Algebraic topology, the use in topology of algebraic methods, mainly homological algebra. Discrete geometry, the study of finite configurations in geometry. Convex geometry, the study of convex sets, which takes its importance from its applications in optimization. Complex geometry, the geometry obtained by replacing real numbers with complex numbers. === Algebra === Algebra is the art of manipulating equations and formulas. Diophantus (3rd century) and al-Khwarizmi (9th century) were the two main precursors of algebra. Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution.", "Diophantus (3rd century) and al-Khwarizmi (9th century) were the two main precursors of algebra. Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution. Al-Khwarizmi introduced systematic methods for transforming equations, such as moving a term from one side of an equation into the other side. The term algebra is derived from the Arabic word al-jabr meaning 'the reunion of broken parts' that he used for naming one of these methods in the title of his main treatise. Algebra became an area in its own right only with Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te (1540\u20131603), who introduced the use of variables for representing unknown or unspecified numbers. Variables allow mathematicians to describe the operations that have to be done on the numbers represented using mathematical formulas. Until the 19th century, algebra consisted mainly of the study of linear equations (presently linear algebra), and polynomial equations in a single unknown, which were called algebraic equations (a term still in use, although it may be ambiguous). During the 19th century, mathematicians began to use variables to represent things other than numbers (such as matrices, modular integers, and geometric transformations), on which generalizations of arithmetic operations are often valid.", "Until the 19th century, algebra consisted mainly of the study of linear equations (presently linear algebra), and polynomial equations in a single unknown, which were called algebraic equations (a term still in use, although it may be ambiguous). During the 19th century, mathematicians began to use variables to represent things other than numbers (such as matrices, modular integers, and geometric transformations), on which generalizations of arithmetic operations are often valid. The concept of algebraic structure addresses this, consisting of a set whose elements are unspecified, of operations acting on the elements of the set, and rules that these operations must follow. The scope of algebra thus grew to include the study of algebraic structures. This object of algebra was called modern algebra or abstract algebra, as established by the influence and works of Emmy Noether, and popularized by Van der Waerden's book Moderne Algebra. Some types of algebraic structures have useful and often fundamental properties, in many areas of mathematics. Their study became autonomous parts of algebra, and include: group theory field theory vector spaces, whose study is essentially the same as linear algebra ring theory commutative algebra, which is the study of commutative rings, includes the study of polynomials, and is a foundational part of algebraic geometry homological algebra Lie algebra and Lie group theory Boolean algebra, which is widely used for the study of the logical structure of computers The study of types of algebraic structures as mathematical objects is the purpose of universal algebra and category theory. The latter applies to every mathematical structure (not only algebraic ones).", "Their study became autonomous parts of algebra, and include: group theory field theory vector spaces, whose study is essentially the same as linear algebra ring theory commutative algebra, which is the study of commutative rings, includes the study of polynomials, and is a foundational part of algebraic geometry homological algebra Lie algebra and Lie group theory Boolean algebra, which is widely used for the study of the logical structure of computers The study of types of algebraic structures as mathematical objects is the purpose of universal algebra and category theory. The latter applies to every mathematical structure (not only algebraic ones). At its origin, it was introduced, together with homological algebra for allowing the algebraic study of non-algebraic objects such as topological spaces; this particular area of application is called algebraic topology. === Calculus and analysis === Calculus, formerly called infinitesimal calculus, was introduced independently and simultaneously by 17th-century mathematicians Newton and Leibniz. It is fundamentally the study of the relationship between variables that depend continuously on each other. Calculus was expanded in the 18th century by Euler with the introduction of the concept of a function and many other results. Presently, \"calculus\" refers mainly to the elementary part of this theory, and \"analysis\" is commonly used for advanced parts. Analysis is further subdivided into real analysis, where variables represent real numbers, and complex analysis, where variables represent complex numbers.", "Presently, \"calculus\" refers mainly to the elementary part of this theory, and \"analysis\" is commonly used for advanced parts. Analysis is further subdivided into real analysis, where variables represent real numbers, and complex analysis, where variables represent complex numbers. Analysis includes many subareas shared by other areas of mathematics which include: Multivariable calculus Functional analysis, where variables represent varying functions Integration, measure theory and potential theory, all strongly related with probability theory on a continuum Ordinary differential equations Partial differential equations Numerical analysis, mainly devoted to the computation on computers of solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in many applications === Discrete mathematics === Discrete mathematics, broadly speaking, is the study of individual, countable mathematical objects. An example is the set of all integers. Because the objects of study here are discrete, the methods of calculus and mathematical analysis do not directly apply. Algorithms\u2014especially their implementation and computational complexity\u2014play a major role in discrete mathematics. The four color theorem and optimal sphere packing were two major problems of discrete mathematics solved in the second half of the 20th century. The P versus NP problem, which remains open to this day, is also important for discrete mathematics, since its solution would potentially impact a large number of computationally difficult problems.", "The four color theorem and optimal sphere packing were two major problems of discrete mathematics solved in the second half of the 20th century. The P versus NP problem, which remains open to this day, is also important for discrete mathematics, since its solution would potentially impact a large number of computationally difficult problems. Discrete mathematics includes: Combinatorics, the art of enumerating mathematical objects that satisfy some given constraints. Originally, these objects were elements or subsets of a given set; this has been extended to various objects, which establishes a strong link between combinatorics and other parts of discrete mathematics. For example, discrete geometry includes counting configurations of geometric shapes. Graph theory and hypergraphs Coding theory, including error correcting codes and a part of cryptography Matroid theory Discrete geometry Discrete probability distributions Game theory (although continuous games are also studied, most common games, such as chess and poker are discrete) Discrete optimization, including combinatorial optimization, integer programming, constraint programming === Mathematical logic and set theory === The two subjects of mathematical logic and set theory have belonged to mathematics since the end of the 19th century. Before this period, sets were not considered to be mathematical objects, and logic, although used for mathematical proofs, belonged to philosophy and was not specifically studied by mathematicians. Before Cantor's study of infinite sets, mathematicians were reluctant to consider actually infinite collections, and considered infinity to be the result of endless enumeration.", "Before this period, sets were not considered to be mathematical objects, and logic, although used for mathematical proofs, belonged to philosophy and was not specifically studied by mathematicians.

Cantor's work offended many mathematicians not only by considering actually infinite sets but by showing that this implies different sizes of infinity, per Cantor's diagonal argument. This led to the controversy over Cantor's set theory. In the same period, various areas of mathematics concluded the former intuitive definitions of the basic mathematical objects were insufficient for ensuring mathematical rigour. This became the foundational crisis of mathematics. It was eventually solved in mainstream mathematics by systematizing the axiomatic method inside a formalized set theory. Roughly speaking, each mathematical object is defined by the set of all similar objects and the properties that these objects must have.", "It was eventually solved in mainstream mathematics by systematizing the axiomatic method inside a formalized set theory. Roughly speaking, each mathematical object is defined by the set of all similar objects and the properties that these objects must have. For example, in Peano arithmetic, the natural numbers are defined by \"zero is a number\", \"each number has a unique successor\", \"each number but zero has a unique predecessor\", and some rules of reasoning. This mathematical abstraction from reality is embodied in the modern philosophy of formalism, as founded by David Hilbert around 1910. The \"nature\" of the objects defined this way is a philosophical problem that mathematicians leave to philosophers, even if many mathematicians have opinions on this nature, and use their opinion\u2014sometimes called \"intuition\"\u2014to guide their study and proofs. The approach allows considering \"logics\" (that is, sets of allowed deducing rules), theorems, proofs, etc. as mathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. For example, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems assert, roughly speaking that, in every consistent formal system that contains the natural numbers, there are theorems that are true (that is provable in a stronger system), but not provable inside the system.", "as mathematical objects, and to prove theorems about them. For example, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems assert, roughly speaking that, in every consistent formal system that contains the natural numbers, there are theorems that are true (that is provable in a stronger system), but not provable inside the system. This approach to the foundations of mathematics was challenged during the first half of the 20th century by mathematicians led by Brouwer, who promoted intuitionistic logic (which explicitly lacks the law of excluded middle). These problems and debates led to a wide expansion of mathematical logic, with subareas such as model theory (modeling some logical theories inside other theories), proof theory, type theory, computability theory and computational complexity theory. Although these aspects of mathematical logic were introduced before the rise of computers, their use in compiler design, formal verification, program analysis, proof assistants and other aspects of computer science, contributed in turn to the expansion of these logical theories. === Statistics and other decision sciences === The field of statistics is a mathematical application that is employed for the collection and processing of data samples, using procedures based on mathematical methods such as, and especially, probability theory. Statisticians generate data with random sampling or randomized experiments. Statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best.", "At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics. == Areas of mathematics == Before the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, regarding the manipulation of numbers, and geometry, regarding the study of shapes. Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics. During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division into four main areas\u2014arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and calculus\u2014endured until the end of the 19th century.", "Statisticians generate data with random sampling or randomized experiments. Statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints. For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence. Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics overlaps with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics. === Computational mathematics === Computational mathematics is the study of mathematical problems that are typically too large for human, numerical capacity. Part of computational mathematics involves numerical analysis, which is the study of methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory. Numerical analysis broadly includes the study of approximation and discretization, with special focus on rounding errors.", "Part of computational mathematics involves numerical analysis, which is the study of methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory. Numerical analysis broadly includes the study of approximation and discretization, with special focus on rounding errors. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing, also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic-matrix-and-graph theory. Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation. == History == === Etymology === The word mathematics comes from the Ancient Greek word m\u00e1th\u0113ma (\u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1), meaning 'something learned, knowledge, mathematics', and the derived expression math\u0113matik\u1e17 t\u00e9khn\u0113 (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7), meaning 'mathematical science'. It entered the English language during the Late Middle English period through French and Latin. Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the math\u0113matikoi (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af)\u2014which at the time meant \"learners\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense. The Pythagoreans were likely the first to constrain the use of the word to just the study of arithmetic and geometry.", "Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the math\u0113matikoi (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af)\u2014which at the time meant \"learners\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense. The Pythagoreans were likely the first to constrain the use of the word to just the study of arithmetic and geometry. By the time of Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC) this meaning was fully established. In Latin and English, until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This change has resulted in several mistranslations: For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of mathematici, meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians. The apparent plural form in English goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural ta math\u0113matik\u00e1 (\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac) and means roughly \"all things mathematical\", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, inherited from Greek. In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to maths or, in North America, math.", "In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to maths or, in North America, math. === Ancient === In addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric peoples may have also known how to count abstract quantities, like time\u2014days, seasons, or years. Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians began using arithmetic, algebra, and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for astronomy. The oldest mathematical texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt are from 2000 to 1800 BC. Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical concept after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system and used a sexagesimal numeral system which is still in use today for measuring angles and time.", "It is in Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system and used a sexagesimal numeral system which is still in use today for measuring angles and time. In the 6th century BC, Greek mathematics began to emerge as a distinct discipline and some Ancient Greeks such as the Pythagoreans appeared to have considered it a subject in its own right. Around 300 BC, Euclid organized mathematical knowledge by way of postulates and first principles, which evolved into the axiomatic method that is used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His book, Elements, is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time. The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be Archimedes (c. 287 \u2013 c. 212 BC) of Syracuse.", "287 \u2013 c. 212 BC) of Syracuse. He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of solids of revolution and used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus. Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are conic sections (Apollonius of Perga, 3rd century BC), trigonometry (Hipparchus of Nicaea, 2nd century BC), and the beginnings of algebra (Diophantus, 3rd century AD). The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition and approximation of sine and cosine, and an early form of infinite series. === Medieval and later === During the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra.", "=== Medieval and later === During the Golden Age of Islam, especially during the 9th and 10th centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of Islamic mathematics was the development of algebra. Other achievements of the Islamic period include advances in spherical trigonometry and the addition of the decimal point to the Arabic numeral system. Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as Al-Khwarizmi, Omar Khayyam and Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b. The Greek and Arabic mathematical texts were in turn translated to Latin during the Middle Ages and made available in Europe. During the early modern period, mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in Western Europe, with innovations that revolutionized mathematics, such as the introduction of variables and symbolic notation by Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te (1540\u20131603), the introduction of logarithms by John Napier in 1614, which greatly simplified numerical calculations, especially for astronomy and marine navigation, the introduction of coordinates by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) for reducing geometry to algebra, and the development of calculus by Isaac Newton (1643\u20131727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646\u20131716). Leonhard Euler (1707\u20131783), the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, unified these innovations into a single corpus with a standardized terminology, and completed them with the discovery and the proof of numerous theorems. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics.", "Leonhard Euler (1707\u20131783), the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, unified these innovations into a single corpus with a standardized terminology, and completed them with the discovery and the proof of numerous theorems. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician Carl Gauss, who made numerous contributions to fields such as algebra, analysis, differential geometry, matrix theory, number theory, and statistics. In the early 20th century, Kurt G\u00f6del transformed mathematics by publishing his incompleteness theorems, which show in part that any consistent axiomatic system\u2014if powerful enough to describe arithmetic\u2014will contain true propositions that cannot be proved. Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made to this very day. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, \"The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews (MR) database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\" == Symbolic notation and terminology == Mathematical notation is widely used in science and engineering for representing complex concepts and properties in a concise, unambiguous, and accurate way.", "Sevryuk, in the January 2006 issue of the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, \"The number of papers and books included in the Mathematical Reviews (MR) database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9 million, and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs.\" == Symbolic notation and terminology == Mathematical notation is widely used in science and engineering for representing complex concepts and properties in a concise, unambiguous, and accurate way. This notation consists of symbols used for representing operations, unspecified numbers, relations and any other mathematical objects, and then assembling them into expressions and formulas. More precisely, numbers and other mathematical objects are represented by symbols called variables, which are generally Latin or Greek letters, and often include subscripts. Operation and relations are generally represented by specific symbols or glyphs, such as + (plus), \u00d7 (multiplication), \u222b {\\textstyle \\int } (integral), = (equal), and < (less than). All these symbols are generally grouped according to specific rules to form expressions and formulas. Normally, expressions and formulas do not appear alone, but are included in sentences of the current language, where expressions play the role of noun phrases and formulas play the role of clauses. Mathematics has developed a rich terminology covering a broad range of fields that study the properties of various abstract, idealized objects and how they interact.", "Normally, expressions and formulas do not appear alone, but are included in sentences of the current language, where expressions play the role of noun phrases and formulas play the role of clauses. Mathematics has developed a rich terminology covering a broad range of fields that study the properties of various abstract, idealized objects and how they interact. It is based on rigorous definitions that provide a standard foundation for communication. An axiom or postulate is a mathematical statement that is taken to be true without need of proof. If a mathematical statement has yet to be proven (or disproven), it is termed a conjecture. Through a series of rigorous arguments employing deductive reasoning, a statement that is proven to be true becomes a theorem. A specialized theorem that is mainly used to prove another theorem is called a lemma. A proven instance that forms part of a more general finding is termed a corollary.", "Calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division into four main areas\u2014arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and calculus\u2014endured until the end of the 19th century. Areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics. The subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the 17th century. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics. The 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification contains no less than sixty-three first-level areas. Some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding number theory (the modern name for higher arithmetic) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have \"geometry\" in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry.", "A specialized theorem that is mainly used to prove another theorem is called a lemma. A proven instance that forms part of a more general finding is termed a corollary. Numerous technical terms used in mathematics are neologisms, such as polynomial and homeomorphism. Other technical terms are words of the common language that are used in an accurate meaning that may differ slightly from their common meaning. For example, in mathematics, \"or\" means \"one, the other or both\", while, in common language, it is either ambiguous or means \"one or the other but not both\" (in mathematics, the latter is called \"exclusive or\"). Finally, many mathematical terms are common words that are used with a completely different meaning. This may lead to sentences that are correct and true mathematical assertions, but appear to be nonsense to people who do not have the required background. For example, \"every free module is flat\" and \"a field is always a ring\".", "This may lead to sentences that are correct and true mathematical assertions, but appear to be nonsense to people who do not have the required background. For example, \"every free module is flat\" and \"a field is always a ring\". == Relationship with sciences == Mathematics is used in most sciences for modeling phenomena, which then allows predictions to be made from experimental laws. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model. Inaccurate predictions, rather than being caused by invalid mathematical concepts, imply the need to change the mathematical model used. For example, the perihelion precession of Mercury could only be explained after the emergence of Einstein's general relativity, which replaced Newton's law of gravitation as a better mathematical model. There is still a philosophical debate whether mathematics is a science. However, in practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists, and mathematics shares much in common with the physical sciences.", "There is still a philosophical debate whether mathematics is a science. However, in practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists, and mathematics shares much in common with the physical sciences. Like them, it is falsifiable, which means in mathematics that, if a result or a theory is wrong, this can be proved by providing a counterexample. Similarly as in science, theories and results (theorems) are often obtained from experimentation. In mathematics, the experimentation may consist of computation on selected examples or of the study of figures or other representations of mathematical objects (often mind representations without physical support). For example, when asked how he came about his theorems, Gauss once replied \"durch planm\u00e4ssiges Tattonieren\" (through systematic experimentation). However, some authors emphasize that mathematics differs from the modern notion of science by not relying on empirical evidence. === Pure and applied mathematics === Until the 19th century, the development of mathematics in the West was mainly motivated by the needs of technology and science, and there was no clear distinction between pure and applied mathematics.", "However, some authors emphasize that mathematics differs from the modern notion of science by not relying on empirical evidence. === Pure and applied mathematics === Until the 19th century, the development of mathematics in the West was mainly motivated by the needs of technology and science, and there was no clear distinction between pure and applied mathematics. For example, the natural numbers and arithmetic were introduced for the need of counting, and geometry was motivated by surveying, architecture, and astronomy. Later, Isaac Newton introduced infinitesimal calculus for explaining the movement of the planets with his law of gravitation. Moreover, most mathematicians were also scientists, and many scientists were also mathematicians. However, a notable exception occurred with the tradition of pure mathematics in Ancient Greece. The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks. In the 19th century, mathematicians such as Karl Weierstrass and Richard Dedekind increasingly focused their research on internal problems, that is, pure mathematics.", "The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks. In the 19th century, mathematicians such as Karl Weierstrass and Richard Dedekind increasingly focused their research on internal problems, that is, pure mathematics. This led to split mathematics into pure mathematics and applied mathematics, the latter being often considered as having a lower value among mathematical purists. However, the lines between the two are frequently blurred. The aftermath of World War II led to a surge in the development of applied mathematics in the US and elsewhere. Many of the theories developed for applications were found interesting from the point of view of pure mathematics, and many results of pure mathematics were shown to have applications outside mathematics; in turn, the study of these applications may give new insights on the \"pure theory\". An example of the first case is the theory of distributions, introduced by Laurent Schwartz for validating computations done in quantum mechanics, which became immediately an important tool of (pure) mathematical analysis. An example of the second case is the decidability of the first-order theory of the real numbers, a problem of pure mathematics that was proved true by Alfred Tarski, with an algorithm that is impossible to implement because of a computational complexity that is much too high.", "An example of the first case is the theory of distributions, introduced by Laurent Schwartz for validating computations done in quantum mechanics, which became immediately an important tool of (pure) mathematical analysis. An example of the second case is the decidability of the first-order theory of the real numbers, a problem of pure mathematics that was proved true by Alfred Tarski, with an algorithm that is impossible to implement because of a computational complexity that is much too high. For getting an algorithm that can be implemented and can solve systems of polynomial equations and inequalities, George Collins introduced the cylindrical algebraic decomposition that became a fundamental tool in real algebraic geometry. In the present day, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a question of personal research aim of mathematicians than a division of mathematics into broad areas. The Mathematics Subject Classification has a section for \"general applied mathematics\" but does not mention \"pure mathematics\". However, these terms are still used in names of some university departments, such as at the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. === Unreasonable effectiveness === The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is a phenomenon that was named and first made explicit by physicist Eugene Wigner. It is the fact that many mathematical theories (even the \"purest\") have applications outside their initial object.", "=== Unreasonable effectiveness === The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is a phenomenon that was named and first made explicit by physicist Eugene Wigner. It is the fact that many mathematical theories (even the \"purest\") have applications outside their initial object. These applications may be completely outside their initial area of mathematics, and may concern physical phenomena that were completely unknown when the mathematical theory was introduced. Examples of unexpected applications of mathematical theories can be found in many areas of mathematics. A notable example is the prime factorization of natural numbers that was discovered more than 2,000 years before its common use for secure internet communications through the RSA cryptosystem. A second historical example is the theory of ellipses. They were studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians as conic sections (that is, intersections of cones with planes). It was almost 2,000 years later that Johannes Kepler discovered that the trajectories of the planets are ellipses.", "They were studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians as conic sections (that is, intersections of cones with planes). It was almost 2,000 years later that Johannes Kepler discovered that the trajectories of the planets are ellipses. In the 19th century, the internal development of geometry (pure mathematics) led to definition and study of non-Euclidean geometries, spaces of dimension higher than three and manifolds. At this time, these concepts seemed totally disconnected from the physical reality, but at the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity that uses fundamentally these concepts. In particular, spacetime of special relativity is a non-Euclidean space of dimension four, and spacetime of general relativity is a (curved) manifold of dimension four. A striking aspect of the interaction between mathematics and physics is when mathematics drives research in physics. This is illustrated by the discoveries of the positron and the baryon \u03a9 \u2212 . {\\displaystyle \\Omega ^{-}.} In both cases, the equations of the theories had unexplained solutions, which led to conjecture of the existence of an unknown particle, and the search for these particles.", "This is illustrated by the discoveries of the positron and the baryon \u03a9 \u2212 . {\\displaystyle \\Omega ^{-}.} In both cases, the equations of the theories had unexplained solutions, which led to conjecture of the existence of an unknown particle, and the search for these particles. In both cases, these particles were discovered a few years later by specific experiments. === Specific sciences === ==== Physics ==== Mathematics and physics have influenced each other over their modern history. Modern physics uses mathematics abundantly, and is also considered to be the motivation of major mathematical developments. ==== Computing ==== Computing is closely related to mathematics in several ways. Theoretical computer science is considered to be mathematical in nature. Communication technologies apply branches of mathematics that may be very old (e.g., arithmetic), especially with respect to transmission security, in cryptography and coding theory.", "Theoretical computer science is considered to be mathematical in nature. Communication technologies apply branches of mathematics that may be very old (e.g., arithmetic), especially with respect to transmission security, in cryptography and coding theory. Discrete mathematics is useful in many areas of computer science, such as complexity theory, information theory, and graph theory. In 1998, the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing seemed to also be partially proven by computer. ==== Biology and chemistry ==== Biology uses probability extensively in fields such as ecology or neurobiology. Most discussion of probability centers on the concept of evolutionary fitness. Ecology heavily uses modeling to simulate population dynamics, study ecosystems such as the predator-prey model, measure pollution diffusion, or to assess climate change. The dynamics of a population can be modeled by coupled differential equations, such as the Lotka\u2013Volterra equations.", "Some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding number theory (the modern name for higher arithmetic) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have \"geometry\" in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry. Algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level areas but are respectively split into several first-level areas. Other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics, such as mathematical logic and foundations. === Number theory === Number theory began with the manipulation of numbers, that is, natural numbers ( N ) , {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {N} ),} and later expanded to integers ( Z ) {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {Z} )} and rational numbers ( Q ) . {\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {Q} ).} Number theory was once called arithmetic, but nowadays this term is mostly used for numerical calculations. Number theory dates back to ancient Babylon and probably China. Two prominent early number theorists were Euclid of ancient Greece and Diophantus of Alexandria.", "Ecology heavily uses modeling to simulate population dynamics, study ecosystems such as the predator-prey model, measure pollution diffusion, or to assess climate change. The dynamics of a population can be modeled by coupled differential equations, such as the Lotka\u2013Volterra equations. Statistical hypothesis testing, is run on data from clinical trials to determine whether a new treatment works. Since the start of the 20th century, chemistry has used computing to model molecules in three dimensions. ==== Earth sciences ==== Structural geology and climatology use probabilistic models to predict the risk of natural catastrophes. Similarly, meteorology, oceanography, and planetology also use mathematics due to their heavy use of models. ==== Social sciences ==== Areas of mathematics used in the social sciences include probability/statistics and differential equations. These are used in linguistics, economics, sociology, and psychology.", "==== Social sciences ==== Areas of mathematics used in the social sciences include probability/statistics and differential equations. These are used in linguistics, economics, sociology, and psychology. Often the fundamental postulate of mathematical economics is that of the rational individual actor \u2013 Homo economicus (lit. 'economic man'). In this model, the individual seeks to maximize their self-interest, and always makes optimal choices using perfect information. This atomistic view of economics allows it to relatively easily mathematize its thinking, because individual calculations are transposed into mathematical calculations. Such mathematical modeling allows one to probe economic mechanisms. Some reject or criticise the concept of Homo economicus.", "Such mathematical modeling allows one to probe economic mechanisms. Some reject or criticise the concept of Homo economicus. Economists note that real people have limited information, make poor choices, and care about fairness and altruism, not just personal gain. Without mathematical modeling, it is hard to go beyond statistical observations or untestable speculation. Mathematical modeling allows economists to create structured frameworks to test hypotheses and analyze complex interactions. Models provide clarity and precision, enabling the translation of theoretical concepts into quantifiable predictions that can be tested against real-world data. At the start of the 20th century, there was a development to express historical movements in formulas. In 1922, Nikolai Kondratiev discerned the ~50-year-long Kondratiev cycle, which explains phases of economic growth or crisis.", "At the start of the 20th century, there was a development to express historical movements in formulas. In 1922, Nikolai Kondratiev discerned the ~50-year-long Kondratiev cycle, which explains phases of economic growth or crisis. Towards the end of the 19th century, mathematicians extended their analysis into geopolitics. Peter Turchin developed cliodynamics in the 1990s. Mathematization of the social sciences is not without risk. In the controversial book Fashionable Nonsense (1997), Sokal and Bricmont denounced the unfounded or abusive use of scientific terminology, particularly from mathematics or physics, in the social sciences. The study of complex systems (evolution of unemployment, business capital, demographic evolution of a population, etc.) uses mathematical knowledge. However, the choice of counting criteria, particularly for unemployment, or of models, can be subject to controversy.", "The study of complex systems (evolution of unemployment, business capital, demographic evolution of a population, etc.) uses mathematical knowledge. However, the choice of counting criteria, particularly for unemployment, or of models, can be subject to controversy. == Philosophy == === Reality === The connection between mathematics and material reality has led to philosophical debates since at least the time of Pythagoras. The ancient philosopher Plato argued that abstractions that reflect material reality have themselves a reality that exists outside space and time. As a result, the philosophical view that mathematical objects somehow exist on their own in abstraction is often referred to as Platonism. Independently of their possible philosophical opinions, modern mathematicians may be generally considered as Platonists, since they think of and talk of their objects of study as real objects. Armand Borel summarized this view of mathematics reality as follows, and provided quotations of G. H.", "Armand Borel summarized this view of mathematics reality as follows, and provided quotations of G. H. Hardy, Charles Hermite, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Albert Einstein that support his views. Something becomes objective (as opposed to \"subjective\") as soon as we are convinced that it exists in the minds of others in the same form as it does in ours and that we can think about it and discuss it together. Because the language of mathematics is so precise, it is ideally suited to defining concepts for which such a consensus exists. In my opinion, that is sufficient to provide us with a feeling of an objective existence, of a reality of mathematics ... Nevertheless, Platonism and the concurrent views on abstraction do not explain the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics (as Platonism assumes mathematics exists independently, but does not explain why it matches reality). === Proposed definitions === There is no general consensus about the definition of mathematics or its epistemological status\u2014that is, its place inside knowledge.", "Nevertheless, Platonism and the concurrent views on abstraction do not explain the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics (as Platonism assumes mathematics exists independently, but does not explain why it matches reality). === Proposed definitions === There is no general consensus about the definition of mathematics or its epistemological status\u2014that is, its place inside knowledge. A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable. There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science. Some just say, \"mathematics is what mathematicians do\". A common approach is to define mathematics by its object of study. Aristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property \"separable in thought\" from real instances set mathematics apart.", "Aristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property \"separable in thought\" from real instances set mathematics apart. In the 19th century, when mathematicians began to address topics\u2014such as infinite sets\u2014which have no clear-cut relation to physical reality, a variety of new definitions were given. With the large number of new areas of mathematics that have appeared since the beginning of the 20th century, defining mathematics by its object of study has become increasingly difficult. For example, in lieu of a definition, Saunders Mac Lane in Mathematics, form and function summarizes the basics of several areas of mathematics, emphasizing their inter-connectedness, and observes: the development of Mathematics provides a tightly connected network of formal rules, concepts, and systems. Nodes of this network are closely bound to procedures useful in human activities and to questions arising in science. The transition from activities to the formal Mathematical systems is guided by a variety of general insights and ideas. Another approach for defining mathematics is to use its methods.", "The transition from activities to the formal Mathematical systems is guided by a variety of general insights and ideas. Another approach for defining mathematics is to use its methods. For example, an area of study is often qualified as mathematics as soon as one can prove theorems\u2014assertions whose validity relies on a proof, that is, a purely logical deduction. === Rigor === Mathematical reasoning requires rigor. This means that the definitions must be absolutely unambiguous and the proofs must be reducible to a succession of applications of inference rules, without any use of empirical evidence and intuition. Rigorous reasoning is not specific to mathematics, but, in mathematics, the standard of rigor is much higher than elsewhere. Despite mathematics' concision, rigorous proofs can require hundreds of pages to express, such as the 255-page Feit\u2013Thompson theorem. The emergence of computer-assisted proofs has allowed proof lengths to further expand.", "Despite mathematics' concision, rigorous proofs can require hundreds of pages to express, such as the 255-page Feit\u2013Thompson theorem. The emergence of computer-assisted proofs has allowed proof lengths to further expand. The result of this trend is a philosophy of the quasi-empiricist proof that can not be considered infallible, but has a probability attached to it. The concept of rigor in mathematics dates back to ancient Greece, where their society encouraged logical, deductive reasoning. However, this rigorous approach would tend to discourage exploration of new approaches, such as irrational numbers and concepts of infinity. The method of demonstrating rigorous proof was enhanced in the sixteenth century through the use of symbolic notation. In the 18th century, social transition led to mathematicians earning their keep through teaching, which led to more careful thinking about the underlying concepts of mathematics. This produced more rigorous approaches, while transitioning from geometric methods to algebraic and then arithmetic proofs.", "Number theory dates back to ancient Babylon and probably China. Two prominent early number theorists were Euclid of ancient Greece and Diophantus of Alexandria. The modern study of number theory in its abstract form is largely attributed to Pierre de Fermat and Leonhard Euler. The field came to full fruition with the contributions of Adrien-Marie Legendre and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Many easily stated number problems have solutions that require sophisticated methods, often from across mathematics. A prominent example is Fermat's Last Theorem. This conjecture was stated in 1637 by Pierre de Fermat, but it was proved only in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, who used tools including scheme theory from algebraic geometry, category theory, and homological algebra. Another example is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.", "In the 18th century, social transition led to mathematicians earning their keep through teaching, which led to more careful thinking about the underlying concepts of mathematics. This produced more rigorous approaches, while transitioning from geometric methods to algebraic and then arithmetic proofs. At the end of the 19th century, it appeared that the definitions of the basic concepts of mathematics were not accurate enough for avoiding paradoxes (non-Euclidean geometries and Weierstrass function) and contradictions (Russell's paradox). This was solved by the inclusion of axioms with the apodictic inference rules of mathematical theories; the re-introduction of axiomatic method pioneered by the ancient Greeks. It results that \"rigor\" is no more a relevant concept in mathematics, as a proof is either correct or erroneous, and a \"rigorous proof\" is simply a pleonasm. Where a special concept of rigor comes into play is in the socialized aspects of a proof, wherein it may be demonstrably refuted by other mathematicians. After a proof has been accepted for many years or even decades, it can then be considered as reliable. Nevertheless, the concept of \"rigor\" may remain useful for teaching to beginners what is a mathematical proof.", "After a proof has been accepted for many years or even decades, it can then be considered as reliable. Nevertheless, the concept of \"rigor\" may remain useful for teaching to beginners what is a mathematical proof. == Training and practice == === Education === Mathematics has a remarkable ability to cross cultural boundaries and time periods. As a human activity, the practice of mathematics has a social side, which includes education, careers, recognition, popularization, and so on. In education, mathematics is a core part of the curriculum and forms an important element of the STEM academic disciplines. Prominent careers for professional mathematicians include mathematics teacher or professor, statistician, actuary, financial analyst, economist, accountant, commodity trader, or computer consultant. Archaeological evidence shows that instruction in mathematics occurred as early as the second millennium BCE in ancient Babylonia. Comparable evidence has been unearthed for scribal mathematics training in the ancient Near East and then for the Greco-Roman world starting around 300 BCE.", "Archaeological evidence shows that instruction in mathematics occurred as early as the second millennium BCE in ancient Babylonia. Comparable evidence has been unearthed for scribal mathematics training in the ancient Near East and then for the Greco-Roman world starting around 300 BCE. The oldest known mathematics textbook is the Rhind papyrus, dated from c. 1650 BCE in Egypt. Due to a scarcity of books, mathematical teachings in ancient India were communicated using memorized oral tradition since the Vedic period (c. 1500 \u2013 c. 500 BCE). In Imperial China during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 CE), a mathematics curriculum was adopted for the civil service exam to join the state bureaucracy.", "500 BCE). In Imperial China during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907 CE), a mathematics curriculum was adopted for the civil service exam to join the state bureaucracy. Following the Dark Ages, mathematics education in Europe was provided by religious schools as part of the Quadrivium. Formal instruction in pedagogy began with Jesuit schools in the 16th and 17th century. Most mathematical curricula remained at a basic and practical level until the nineteenth century, when it began to flourish in France and Germany. The oldest journal addressing instruction in mathematics was L'Enseignement Math\u00e9matique, which began publication in 1899. The Western advancements in science and technology led to the establishment of centralized education systems in many nation-states, with mathematics as a core component\u2014initially for its military applications. While the content of courses varies, in the present day nearly all countries teach mathematics to students for significant amounts of time.", "The Western advancements in science and technology led to the establishment of centralized education systems in many nation-states, with mathematics as a core component\u2014initially for its military applications. While the content of courses varies, in the present day nearly all countries teach mathematics to students for significant amounts of time. During school, mathematical capabilities and positive expectations have a strong association with career interest in the field. Extrinsic factors such as feedback motivation by teachers, parents, and peer groups can influence the level of interest in mathematics. Some students studying mathematics may develop an apprehension or fear about their performance in the subject. This is known as mathematical anxiety, and is considered the most prominent of the disorders impacting academic performance. Mathematical anxiety can develop due to various factors such as parental and teacher attitudes, social stereotypes, and personal traits. Help to counteract the anxiety can come from changes in instructional approaches, by interactions with parents and teachers, and by tailored treatments for the individual.", "Mathematical anxiety can develop due to various factors such as parental and teacher attitudes, social stereotypes, and personal traits. Help to counteract the anxiety can come from changes in instructional approaches, by interactions with parents and teachers, and by tailored treatments for the individual. === Psychology (aesthetic, creativity and intuition) === The validity of a mathematical theorem relies only on the rigor of its proof, which could theoretically be done automatically by a computer program. This does not mean that there is no place for creativity in a mathematical work. On the contrary, many important mathematical results (theorems) are solutions of problems that other mathematicians failed to solve, and the invention of a way for solving them may be a fundamental way of the solving process. An extreme example is Apery's theorem: Roger Apery provided only the ideas for a proof, and the formal proof was given only several months later by three other mathematicians. Creativity and rigor are not the only psychological aspects of the activity of mathematicians. Some mathematicians can see their activity as a game, more specifically as solving puzzles.", "Creativity and rigor are not the only psychological aspects of the activity of mathematicians. Some mathematicians can see their activity as a game, more specifically as solving puzzles. This aspect of mathematical activity is emphasized in recreational mathematics. Mathematicians can find an aesthetic value to mathematics. Like beauty, it is hard to define, it is commonly related to elegance, which involves qualities like simplicity, symmetry, completeness, and generality. G. H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that the aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics.", "H. Hardy in A Mathematician's Apology expressed the belief that the aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He also identified other criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, and inevitability, which contribute to mathematical aesthetics. Paul Erd\u0151s expressed this sentiment more ironically by speaking of \"The Book\", a supposed divine collection of the most beautiful proofs. The 1998 book Proofs from THE BOOK, inspired by Erd\u0151s, is a collection of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments. Some examples of particularly elegant results included are Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers and the fast Fourier transform for harmonic analysis. Some feel that to consider mathematics a science is to downplay its artistry and history in the seven traditional liberal arts. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematical results are created (as in art) or discovered (as in science).", "Some feel that to consider mathematics a science is to downplay its artistry and history in the seven traditional liberal arts. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematical results are created (as in art) or discovered (as in science). The popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. == Cultural impact == === Artistic expression === Notes that sound well together to a Western ear are sounds whose fundamental frequencies of vibration are in simple ratios. For example, an octave doubles the frequency and a perfect fifth multiplies it by 3 2 {\\textstyle {\\frac {3}{2}}} . Humans, as well as some other animals, find symmetric patterns to be more beautiful. Mathematically, the symmetries of an object form a group known as the symmetry group. For example, the group underlying mirror symmetry is the cyclic group of two elements, Z / 2 Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /2\\mathbb {Z} } .", "Mathematically, the symmetries of an object form a group known as the symmetry group. For example, the group underlying mirror symmetry is the cyclic group of two elements, Z / 2 Z {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} /2\\mathbb {Z} } . A Rorschach test is a figure invariant by this symmetry, as are butterfly and animal bodies more generally (at least on the surface). Waves on the sea surface possess translation symmetry: moving one's viewpoint by the distance between wave crests does not change one's view of the sea. Fractals possess self-similarity. === Popularization === Popular mathematics is the act of presenting mathematics without technical terms. Presenting mathematics may be hard since the general public suffers from mathematical anxiety and mathematical objects are highly abstract. However, popular mathematics writing can overcome this by using applications or cultural links.", "This conjecture was stated in 1637 by Pierre de Fermat, but it was proved only in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, who used tools including scheme theory from algebraic geometry, category theory, and homological algebra. Another example is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Stated in 1742 by Christian Goldbach, it remains unproven despite considerable effort. Number theory includes several subareas, including analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, geometry of numbers (method oriented), Diophantine analysis, and transcendence theory (problem oriented). === Geometry === Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It started with empirical recipes concerning shapes, such as lines, angles and circles, which were developed mainly for the needs of surveying and architecture, but has since blossomed out into many other subfields. A fundamental innovation was the ancient Greeks' introduction of the concept of proofs, which require that every assertion must be proved. For example, it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that, say, two lengths are equal; their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results (theorems) and a few basic statements.", "Presenting mathematics may be hard since the general public suffers from mathematical anxiety and mathematical objects are highly abstract. However, popular mathematics writing can overcome this by using applications or cultural links. Despite this, mathematics is rarely the topic of popularization in printed or televised media. === Awards and prize problems === The most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal, established by Canadian John Charles Fields in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to up to four individuals. It is considered the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Other prestigious mathematics awards include: The Abel Prize, instituted in 2002 and first awarded in 2003 The Chern Medal for lifetime achievement, introduced in 2009 and first awarded in 2010 The AMS Leroy P. Steele Prize, awarded since 1970 The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, also for lifetime achievement, instituted in 1978 A famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list has achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least thirteen of the problems (depending how some are interpreted) have been solved.", "Steele Prize, awarded since 1970 The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, also for lifetime achievement, instituted in 1978 A famous list of 23 open problems, called \"Hilbert's problems\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list has achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least thirteen of the problems (depending how some are interpreted) have been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"Millennium Prize Problems\", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the Riemann hypothesis, duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. To date, only one of these problems, the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, has been solved, by the Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman. == See also == == Notes == == References == === Citations === === Other sources === == Further reading ==", "A fundamental innovation was the ancient Greeks' introduction of the concept of proofs, which require that every assertion must be proved. For example, it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that, say, two lengths are equal; their equality must be proven via reasoning from previously accepted results (theorems) and a few basic statements. The basic statements are not subject to proof because they are self-evident (postulates), or are part of the definition of the subject of study (axioms). This principle, foundational for all mathematics, was first elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by Euclid around 300 BC in his book Elements. The resulting Euclidean geometry is the study of shapes and their arrangements constructed from lines, planes and circles in the Euclidean plane (plane geometry) and the three-dimensional Euclidean space. Euclidean geometry was developed without change of methods or scope until the 17th century, when Ren\u00e9 Descartes introduced what is now called Cartesian coordinates. This constituted a major change of paradigm: Instead of defining real numbers as lengths of line segments (see number line), it allowed the representation of points using their coordinates, which are numbers. Algebra (and later, calculus) can thus be used to solve geometrical problems.", "This constituted a major change of paradigm: Instead of defining real numbers as lengths of line segments (see number line), it allowed the representation of points using their coordinates, which are numbers. Algebra (and later, calculus) can thus be used to solve geometrical problems. Geometry was split into two new subfields: synthetic geometry, which uses purely geometrical methods, and analytic geometry, which uses coordinates systemically. Analytic geometry allows the study of curves unrelated to circles and lines. Such curves can be defined as the graph of functions, the study of which led to differential geometry. They can also be defined as implicit equations, often polynomial equations (which spawned algebraic geometry). Analytic geometry also makes it possible to consider Euclidean spaces of higher than three dimensions. In the 19th century, mathematicians discovered non-Euclidean geometries, which do not follow the parallel postulate.", "Analytic geometry also makes it possible to consider Euclidean spaces of higher than three dimensions. In the 19th century, mathematicians discovered non-Euclidean geometries, which do not follow the parallel postulate. By questioning that postulate's truth, this discovery has been viewed as joining Russell's paradox in revealing the foundational crisis of mathematics. This aspect of the crisis was solved by systematizing the axiomatic method, and adopting that the truth of the chosen axioms is not a mathematical problem. In turn, the axiomatic method allows for the study of various geometries obtained either by changing the axioms or by considering properties that do not change under specific transformations of the space. Today's subareas of geometry include: Projective geometry, introduced in the 16th century by Girard Desargues, extends Euclidean geometry by adding points at infinity at which parallel lines intersect. This simplifies many aspects of classical geometry by unifying the treatments for intersecting and parallel lines. Affine geometry, the study of properties relative to parallelism and independent from the concept of length.", "Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all human societies. Definitions of music vary widely in substance and approach. While scholars agree that music is defined by a small number of specific elements, there is no consensus as to what these necessary elements are. Music is often characterized as a highly versatile medium for expressing human creativity. Diverse activities are involved in the creation of music, and are often divided into categories of composition, improvisation, and performance. Music may be performed using a wide variety of musical instruments, including the human voice. It can also be composed, sequenced, or otherwise produced to be indirectly played mechanically or electronically, such as via a music box, barrel organ, or digital audio workstation software on a computer.", "Music may be performed using a wide variety of musical instruments, including the human voice.

Music often plays a key role in social events and religious ceremonies. The techniques of making music are often transmitted as part of a cultural tradition. Music is played in public and private contexts, highlighted at events such as festivals and concerts for various different types of ensembles.

The culture surrounding music extends into areas of academic study, journalism, philosophy, psychology, and therapy.", "=== Asian cultures === Asian music covers a swath of music cultures surveyed in the articles on Arabia, Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. These traditions, with several reaching into antiquity, share historical ties through trade, religion and philosophical exchange, yet preserve their unique local aesthetics and performance styles. Indian classical music is one of the oldest musical traditions in the world. Sculptures from the Indus Valley civilization show dance and old musical instruments, like the seven-holed flute. Stringed instruments and drums have been recovered from Harappa and Mohenjo Daro by excavations carried out by Mortimer Wheeler. The Rigveda, an ancient Hindu text, has elements of present Indian music, with musical notation to denote the meter and mode of chanting. Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or raga rhythmically organized through talas. The poem Cilappatikaram provides information about how new scales can be formed by modal shifting of the tonic from an existing scale.", "Indian classical music (marga) is monophonic, and based on a single melody line or raga rhythmically organized through talas. The poem Cilappatikaram provides information about how new scales can be formed by modal shifting of the tonic from an existing scale. Present day Hindi music was influenced by Persian traditional music and Afghan Mughals. Carnatic music, popular in the southern states, is largely devotional; the majority of the songs are addressed to the Hindu deities. There are songs emphasizing love and other social issues. Indonesian music has been formed since the Bronze Age culture migrated to the Indonesian archipelago in the 2nd-3rd centuries BCE. Indonesian traditional music uses percussion instruments, especially kendang and gongs. Some of them developed elaborate and distinctive instruments, such as the sasando stringed instrument on the island of Rote, the Sundanese angklung, and the complex and sophisticated Javanese and Balinese gamelan orchestras.", "Indonesian traditional music uses percussion instruments, especially kendang and gongs. Some of them developed elaborate and distinctive instruments, such as the sasando stringed instrument on the island of Rote, the Sundanese angklung, and the complex and sophisticated Javanese and Balinese gamelan orchestras. Indonesia is the home of gong chime, a general term for a set of small, high pitched pot gongs. Gongs are usually placed in order of note, with the boss up on a string held in a low wooden frame. The most popular form of Indonesian music is gamelan, an ensemble of tuned percussion instruments that include metallophones, drums, gongs and spike fiddles along with bamboo suling (like a flute). Chinese classical music, the traditional art or court music of China, has a history stretching over about 3,000 years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5 + 7 = 12) as does European-influenced music.", "It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5 + 7 = 12) as does European-influenced music. === Western classical === ==== Early music ==== The medieval music era (500 to 1400), which took place during the Middle Ages, started with the introduction of monophonic (single melodic line) chanting into Catholic Church services. Musical notation was used since ancient times in Greek culture, but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the Catholic Church, so chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found, in written form, from before 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant of the Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant. Alongside these traditions of sacred and church music there existed a vibrant tradition of secular song (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are L\u00e9onin, P\u00e9rotin, Guillaume de Machaut, and Walther von der Vogelweide. Renaissance music (c.", "Examples of composers from this period are L\u00e9onin, P\u00e9rotin, Guillaume de Machaut, and Walther von der Vogelweide. Renaissance music (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular themes, such as courtly love. Around 1450, the printing press was invented, which made printed sheet music much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music spread musical styles quicker and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously.", "Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include Guillaume Du Fay, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Thomas Morley, Orlando di Lasso and Josquin des Prez. As musical activity shifted from the church to aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and France; they are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain. ==== Common practice period ==== ===== Baroque ===== The Baroque era of music took place from 1600 to 1750, coinciding with the flourishing of the Baroque artistic style in Europe.", "Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain. ==== Common practice period ==== ===== Baroque ===== The Baroque era of music took place from 1600 to 1750, coinciding with the flourishing of the Baroque artistic style in Europe. The start of the Baroque era was marked by the penning of the first operas. Polyphonic contrapuntal music (music with separate, simultaneous melodic lines) remained important during this period. German Baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings, brass, and woodwinds, as well as for choirs and keyboard instruments such as pipe organ, harpsichord, and clavichord. Musical complexity increased during this time. Several major musical forms were created, some of them which persisted into later periods, seeing further development. These include the fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto.", "Several major musical forms were created, some of them which persisted into later periods, seeing further development. These include the fugue, the invention, the sonata, and the concerto. The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach (Cello suites), George Frideric Handel (Messiah), Georg Philipp Telemann and Antonio Vivaldi (The Four Seasons). ===== Classicism ===== The music of the Classical period (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the Classical period should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western art music from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods). Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the Baroque music which preceded it. The main style was homophony, where a prominent melody and a subordinate chordal accompaniment part are clearly distinct.", "Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the Baroque music which preceded it. The main style was homophony, where a prominent melody and a subordinate chordal accompaniment part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the fortepiano, the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era harpsichord and pipe organ as the main keyboard instrument (though pipe organ continued to be used in sacred music, such as Masses). Importance was given to instrumental music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the sonata, the concerto, and the symphony. Other main kinds were the trio, string quartet, serenade and divertimento. The sonata was the most important and developed form.", "Other main kinds were the trio, string quartet, serenade and divertimento. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used chamber music and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the basso continuo group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a string quartet would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The practice of improvised chord-playing by the continuo keyboardist or lute player, a hallmark of Baroque music, underwent a gradual decline between 1750 and 1800. One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts.", "Listening to music is a common means of entertainment. The culture surrounding music extends into areas of academic study, journalism, philosophy, psychology, and therapy. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and publishers of sheet music and recordings. Technology facilitating the recording and reproduction of music has historically included sheet music, microphones, phonographs, and tape machines, with playback of digital music being a common use for MP3 players, CD players, and smartphones. == Etymology and terminology == The modern English word music came into use in the 1630s. It descends from Middle English musike, which in turn descends from Old French musique, then Latin m\u016bsica\u2014and ultimately from Ancient Greek mousik\u00e9 techn\u0113 (\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7), a phrase meaning \"art of the Muses\". The Muses were nine deities in Ancient Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences. They were included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod, and eventually came to be associated with music specifically.", "The practice of improvised chord-playing by the continuo keyboardist or lute player, a hallmark of Baroque music, underwent a gradual decline between 1750 and 1800. One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres, such as opera and oratorio, became more popular. The best known composers of Classicism are Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Christian Bach, Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.", "The best known composers of Classicism are Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Christian Bach, Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism. ===== Romanticism ===== Romantic music (c. 1820 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the Romantic styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as Wagner and Brahms attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic tone poems, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music.", "Romantic composers such as Wagner and Brahms attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic tone poems, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted nationalistic pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by folk music. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition. Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the syncretism of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. Romantic love or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases, the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the sonata form used in string quartets and symphonies), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions.", "In some cases, the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the sonata form used in string quartets and symphonies), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes. In the years after 1800, the music developed by Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short motifs, developed organically, came to replace melody as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his Fifth Symphony). Later Romantic composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, and Gustav Mahler used more unusual chords and more dissonance to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works.", "Later Romantic composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, and Gustav Mahler used more unusual chords and more dissonance to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic chromatic alterations of tonality, such as extended chords and altered chords, which created new sound \"colors.\" The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the Industrial Revolution helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do urban society. It also saw a new diversity in theatre music, including operetta, and musical comedy and other forms of musical theatre. === 20th and 21st century === In the 19th century, a key way new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home, on their piano or other common instruments, such as the violin. With 20th-century music, the invention of new electric technologies such as radio broadcasting and mass market availability of gramophone records meant sound recordings heard by listeners (on the radio or record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and phonographs were used to replay and distribute music; anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, symphonies and big bands in their own living room.", "With 20th-century music, the invention of new electric technologies such as radio broadcasting and mass market availability of gramophone records meant sound recordings heard by listeners (on the radio or record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and phonographs were used to replay and distribute music; anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, symphonies and big bands in their own living room. During the 19th century, the focus on sheet music had restricted access to new music to middle and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and other instruments. Radios and record players allowed lower-income people, who could not afford an opera or symphony concert ticket, to hear this music. As well, people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles. The focus of art music in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of World War I influenced many of the arts, including music, and composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds.", "The focus of art music in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of World War I influenced many of the arts, including music, and composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. Traditional music styles such as jazz and folk music were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. Igor Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and John Cage were influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of sound recording and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the acousmatic and musique concr\u00e8te schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the multitrack recording system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.", "The introduction of the multitrack recording system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance. Jazz evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes, improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung note. Rock music is a genre of popular music that developed in the 1950s from rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, and country music. The sound of rock often revolves around the electric or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong back beat laid down by a rhythm section. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments.", "The sound of rock often revolves around the electric or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong back beat laid down by a rhythm section. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its \"purest form\", it \"has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody.\" The traditional rhythm section for popular music is rhythm guitar, electric bass guitar, drums. Some bands have keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, analog synthesizers. In the 1980s, pop musicians began using digital synthesizers, such as the DX-7 synthesizer, electronic drum machines such as the TR-808 and synth bass devices (such as the TB-303) or synth bass keyboards. In the 1990s, an increasingly large range of computerized hardware musical devices and instruments and software (e.g. digital audio workstations) were used. In the 2020s, soft synths and computer music apps make it possible for bedroom producers to create and record types of music, such as electronic dance music, in their home, adding sampled and digital instruments and editing the recording digitally.", "digital audio workstations) were used. In the 2020s, soft synths and computer music apps make it possible for bedroom producers to create and record types of music, such as electronic dance music, in their home, adding sampled and digital instruments and editing the recording digitally. In the 1990s, bands in genres such as nu metal began including DJs in their bands. DJs create music by manipulating recorded music, using a DJ mixer. == Creation == === Composition === \"Composition\" is the act or practice of creating a song, an instrumental music piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, the composer typically orchestrates his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration.", "The Muses were nine deities in Ancient Greek mythology who presided over the arts and sciences. They were included in tales by the earliest Western authors, Homer and Hesiod, and eventually came to be associated with music specifically. Over time, Polyhymnia would reside over music more prominently than the other muses. The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish m\u00fasica and French musique via spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the Italian musica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muz\u00efka. The modern Western world usually defines music as an all-encompassing term used to describe diverse genres, styles, and traditions. This is not the case worldwide, and languages such as modern Indonesian (musik) and Shona (musakazo) have recently adopted words to reflect this universal conception, as they did not have words that fit exactly the Western scope. Before Western contact in East Asia, neither Japan nor China had a single word that encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally, they often regarded music in such a fashion. The closest word to mean music in Chinese, yue, shares a character with le, meaning joy, and originally referred to all the arts before narrowing in meaning.", "In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, the composer typically orchestrates his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead, compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed \"interpretation\". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others.", "Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as performance practice, whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer. Although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the blues, a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces.", "A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music, and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Witold Lutos\u0142awski. A commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers. === Performance === Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or piano piece, guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other musical part is played. In classical music, a work is written in music notation by a composer and then performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change.", "In classical music, a work is written in music notation by a composer and then performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a cover song, they can make changes such as adding a guitar solo or inserting an introduction. A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)\u2014which is the norm in classical music, jazz big bands, and many popular music styles\u2013or improvised over a chord progression (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small jazz and blues groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, concert bands and choirs are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader.", "Rehearsals of orchestras, concert bands and choirs are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Many cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in Bali, include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organized performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or music competitions. Chamber music, which is music for a small ensemble with only one or a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works. === Improvisation === Musical improvisation is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework, chord progression, or riffs.", "Chamber music, which is music for a small ensemble with only one or a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works. === Improvisation === Musical improvisation is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework, chord progression, or riffs. Improvisers use the notes of the chord, various scales that are associated with each chord, and chromatic ornaments and passing tones which may be neither chord tones nor from the typical scales associated with a chord. Musical improvisation can be done with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as blues, jazz, and jazz fusion, in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines, and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments, and basso continuo keyboard players improvised chord voicings based on figured bass notation. As well, the top soloists were expected to be able to improvise pieces such as preludes.", "In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments, and basso continuo keyboard players improvised chord voicings based on figured bass notation. As well, the top soloists were expected to be able to improvise pieces such as preludes. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso cadenzas during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as \"common practice\" Western art music performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses, and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role, as more and more music was notated in scores and parts for musicians to play. At the same time, some 20th and 21st century art music composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In Indian classical music, improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances. == Art and entertainment == Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet music of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano.", "== Art and entertainment == Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through sheet music scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the sheet music of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of the phonograph, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home tape recorders in the 1980s and digital music in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or playlists of favourite songs and take them with them on a portable cassette player or MP3 player. Some music lovers create mix tapes of favourite songs, which serve as a \"self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved\". Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure and derive income elsewhere. Professional musicians are employed by institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in marching bands, concert bands and popular music groups), religious institutions, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or film production companies, and music schools.", "Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure and derive income elsewhere. Professional musicians are employed by institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in marching bands, concert bands and popular music groups), religious institutions, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or film production companies, and music schools. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or session musicians, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take lessons with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community concert bands and community orchestras. A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed.", "A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in popular music forms such as rock, where illegally taped live concerts are prized by music lovers. In the jam band scene, live, improvised jam sessions are preferred to studio recordings. === Notation === Music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a melody, are notated. Music notation often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state the song is a \"slow blues\" or a \"fast swing\", which indicates the tempo and the genre.", "Before Western contact in East Asia, neither Japan nor China had a single word that encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally, they often regarded music in such a fashion. The closest word to mean music in Chinese, yue, shares a character with le, meaning joy, and originally referred to all the arts before narrowing in meaning. Africa is too diverse to make firm generalizations, but the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has emphasized African music's often inseparable connection to dance and speech in general. Some African cultures, such as the Songye people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Tiv people of Nigeria, have a strong and broad conception of 'music' but no corresponding word in their native languages. Other words commonly translated as music often have more specific meanings in their respective cultures: the Hindi word for music, sangita, properly refers to art music, while the many Indigenous languages of the Americas have words for music that refer specifically to song but describe instrumental music regardless. Though the Arabic musiqi can refer to all music, it is usually used for instrumental and metric music, while khandan identifies vocal and improvised music.", "Music notation often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state the song is a \"slow blues\" or a \"fast swing\", which indicates the tempo and the genre. To read notation, a person must have an understanding of music theory, harmony and the performance practice associated with a particular song or piece's genre. Written notation varies with the style and period of music. Nowadays, notated music is produced as sheet music or, for individuals with computer scorewriter programs, as an image on a computer screen. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or genre. In genres requiring musical improvisation, the performer often plays from music where only the chord changes and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre e.g., jazz or country music.", "To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or genre.

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the lead sheet, which notates the melody, chords, lyrics (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. Fake books are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit rhythm section members to improvise an accompaniment part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz \"big bands.\" In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in tablature (often abbreviated as \"tab\"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tablature was used in the Baroque era to notate music for the lute, a stringed, fretted instrument. === Oral and aural tradition === Many types of music, such as traditional blues and folk music were not written down in sheet music; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down orally, from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song \"by ear\".", "Tablature was used in the Baroque era to notate music for the lute, a stringed, fretted instrument. === Oral and aural tradition === Many types of music, such as traditional blues and folk music were not written down in sheet music; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down orally, from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song \"by ear\". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as \"traditional\" or as a \"folk song\". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song. == Elements == Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of \"element\" being used, these can include pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form, and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, the UK, and the US.", "Depending on the definition of \"element\" being used, these can include pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form, and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, the UK, and the US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre, and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed upon. Below is a list of the three official versions of the \"elements of music\": Australia: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics and expression, rhythm, form and structure. UK: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics, duration, tempo, structure. USA: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics, rhythm, form, harmony, style/articulation. In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: \"appropriate musical notations\" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the \"elements of music\" to the \"inter-related dimensions of music\". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure, and appropriate musical notations.", "In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: \"appropriate musical notations\" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the \"elements of music\" to the \"inter-related dimensions of music\". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure, and appropriate musical notations. The phrase \"the elements of music\" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the \"rudimentary elements of music\" and the \"perceptual elements of music\". === Pitch === Pitch is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note, or tone is \"higher\" or \"lower\" than another musical sound, note, or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high piccolo note or whistling tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a bass drum. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical melodies, basslines and chords. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise.", "We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical melodies, basslines and chords. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano than to try to discern the pitch of a crash cymbal that is struck. === Melody === A melody, also called a \"tune\", is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as scales or modes. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or key of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and C; these are the \"white notes\" on a piano keyboard.", "The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or key of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and C; these are the \"white notes\" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, Bebop-era jazz from the 1940s and contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many chromatic notes (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the \"white notes\" and \"black notes\" and unusual scales, such as the whole tone scale (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F\u266f, G\u266f and A\u266f). A low musical line played by bass instruments, such as double bass, electric bass, or tuba, is called a bassline. === Harmony === Harmony refers to the \"vertical\" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time creates a chord. Usually, this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor tonality (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock, and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the \"home note\" or tonic to which the piece generally resolves, and the character (e.g. major or minor) of the scale in use.", "In music written using the system of major-minor tonality (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock, and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the \"home note\" or tonic to which the piece generally resolves, and the character (e.g. major or minor) of the scale in use. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop, and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820\u20131900) often contains multiple keys, as does jazz, especially Bebop jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or \"home note\" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars. === Rhythm === Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. Meter animates time in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars, which in Western classical, popular, and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as Waltz time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping.", "Meter animates time in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars, which in Western classical, popular, and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as Waltz time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the backbeat used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or common time) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the snare drum, a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the rhythm section, which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as jazz and bluegrass, double bass) and a drum kit player. === Texture === Musical texture is the overall sound of a piece of music or song. The texture of a piece or song is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments.", "Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One layer can be a string section or another brass. The thickness is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between parts or lines of music: monophony: a single melody (or \"tune\") with neither instrumental accompaniment nor a harmony part. A mother singing a lullaby to her baby would be an example. heterophony: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different ornaments to the melody. Two bluegrass fiddlers playing the same traditional fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody by some degree and each add different ornaments.", "Other words commonly translated as music often have more specific meanings in their respective cultures: the Hindi word for music, sangita, properly refers to art music, while the many Indigenous languages of the Americas have words for music that refer specifically to song but describe instrumental music regardless. Though the Arabic musiqi can refer to all music, it is usually used for instrumental and metric music, while khandan identifies vocal and improvised music. == History == === Origins and prehistory === It is often debated to what extent the origins of music will ever be understood, and there are competing theories that aim to explain it. Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the origin of language, and there is disagreement surrounding whether music developed before, after, or simultaneously with language. A similar source of contention surrounds whether music was the intentional result of natural selection or was a byproduct spandrel of evolution. The earliest influential theory was proposed by Charles Darwin in 1871, who stated that music arose as a form of sexual selection, perhaps via mating calls. Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other sexual selection methods, though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted the theory. Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor, improving long-distance communication, benefiting communication with the divine, assisting in community cohesion or as a defense to scare off predators.", "heterophony: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different ornaments to the melody. Two bluegrass fiddlers playing the same traditional fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody by some degree and each add different ornaments. polyphony: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. Choral music written in the Renaissance music era was typically written in this style. A round, which is a song such as \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is an example of polyphony. homophony: a clear melody supported by chordal accompaniment. Most Western popular music songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture. Music that contains a large number of independent parts (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a \"thicker\" or \"denser\" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo flute melody accompanied by a single cello).", "Most Western popular music songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440 Hz A note sounds different when it is played on oboe, piano, violin, or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different embouchures), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., gut strings versus steel strings). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently). The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the spectrum, envelope, and overtones of a note or musical sound.", "Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently). The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the spectrum, envelope, and overtones of a note or musical sound. For electric instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and electric piano, the performer can also change the tone by adjusting equalizer controls, tone controls on the instrument, and by using electronic effects units such as distortion pedals. The tone of the electric Hammond organ is controlled by adjusting drawbars. === Expression === Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding phrasing, by adding effects such as vibrato (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments, and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., ritardando or accelerando, which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or fermatas on a cadence, and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more legato, which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter). Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato, etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g.", "Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato, etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements to convey \"an indication of mood, spirit, character etc.\" and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music, although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music. === Form === In music, form describes the overall structure or plan of a song or piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the early 20th century, Tin Pan Alley songs and Broadway musical songs were often in AABA thirty-two-bar form, in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody (with variation) and the B section provided a contrasting melody or harmony for eight bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in verse-chorus form, which comprises a sequence of verse and chorus (\"refrain\") sections, with new lyrics for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of strophic form, sometimes in conjunction with the twelve bar blues.", "From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in verse-chorus form, which comprises a sequence of verse and chorus (\"refrain\") sections, with new lyrics for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of strophic form, sometimes in conjunction with the twelve bar blues. In the tenth edition of The Oxford Companion to Music, Percy Scholes defines musical form as \"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\" Examples of common forms of Western music include the fugue, the invention, sonata-allegro, canon, strophic, theme and variations, and rondo. Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and fugue (although musicologist Alfred Mann emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.) Where a piece cannot readily be broken into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or programme), it is said to be through-composed. Such is often the case with a fantasia, prelude, rhapsody, etude (or study), symphonic poem, Bagatelle, impromptu or similar composition. Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as \"sectional, developmental, or variational.\" == Philosophy == The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music and has connections with questions in metaphysics and aesthetics. Questions include: What is the definition of music? (What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for classifying something as music?) What is the relationship between music and mind?", "Questions include: What is the definition of music? (What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for classifying something as music?) What is the relationship between music and mind? What does music history reveal to us about the world? What is the connection between music and emotions? What is meaning in relation to music? In ancient times, such as with the Ancient Greeks, the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Immanuel Kant.", "In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Immanuel Kant. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been foregrounded. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by Peter Kivy, Jerrold Levinson, Roger Scruton, and Stephen Davies. However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether music can express meaning.", "However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether music can express meaning. Harry Partch and some other musicologists, such as Kyle Gann, have studied and tried to popularize microtonal music and the usage of alternate musical scales. Modern composers like La Monte Young, Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca paid much attention to a scale called just intonation. It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions, intellect, and psychology; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. Plato suggests in The Republic that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII). In Ancient China, Confucius believed that music and rituals or rites are interconnected and harmonious with nature; he stated that music was the harmonization of heaven and earth, while the order was brought by the rites order, making them extremely crucial functions in society.", "Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII). In Ancient China, Confucius believed that music and rituals or rites are interconnected and harmonious with nature; he stated that music was the harmonization of heaven and earth, while the order was brought by the rites order, making them extremely crucial functions in society. == Psychology == Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience. Research in this field and its subfields are primarily empirical; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music performance, composition, education, criticism, and therapy, as well as investigations of human aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and social behavior. === Neuroscience === Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion.", "These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET). === Cognitive musicology === Cognitive musicology is a branch of cognitive science concerned with computationally modeling musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Cognitive musicology investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Research often includes biologically inspired models of computation, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs. This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated.", "Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other sexual selection methods, though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted the theory. Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor, improving long-distance communication, benefiting communication with the divine, assisting in community cohesion or as a defense to scare off predators. Prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from paleolithic archaeology sites. The disputed Divje Babe flute, a perforated cave bear femur, is at least 40,000 years old, though there is considerable debate surrounding whether it is truly a musical instrument or an object formed by animals. The earliest objects whose designations as musical instruments are widely accepted are bone flutes from the Swabian Jura, Germany, namely from the Geissenkl\u00f6sterle, Hohle Fels and Vogelherd caves. Dated to the Aurignacian (of the Upper Paleolithic) and used by Early European modern humans, from all three caves there are eight examples, four made from the wing bones of birds and four from mammoth ivory; three of these are near complete. Three flutes from the Geissenkl\u00f6sterle are dated as the oldest, c. 43,150\u201339,370 BP.", "Research often includes biologically inspired models of computation, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs. This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated. === Psychoacoustics === Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound (including speech and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of psychophysics. === Evolutionary musicology === Evolutionary musicology concerns the \"origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution\", and \"music evolution and human evolution\". It seeks to understand music perception and activity in the context of evolutionary theory.", "=== Evolutionary musicology === Evolutionary musicology concerns the \"origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution\", and \"music evolution and human evolution\". It seeks to understand music perception and activity in the context of evolutionary theory. Charles Darwin speculated that music may have held an adaptive advantage and functioned as a protolanguage, a view which has spawned several competing theories of music evolution. An alternate view sees music as a by-product of linguistic evolution; a type of \"auditory cheesecake\" that pleases the senses without providing any adaptive function. This view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers. === Cultural effects === An individual's culture or ethnicity plays a role in their music cognition, including their preferences, emotional reaction, and musical memory. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features. Additionally, individuals' musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music.", "Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features. Additionally, individuals' musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music. === Perceptual === Since the emergence of the study of psychoacoustics in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we hear music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book Psychology of Music, identified four \"psychological attributes of sound\". These were: \"pitch, loudness, time, and timbre\" (p. 3). He did not call them the \"elements of music\" but referred to them as \"elemental components\" (p.", "3). He did not call them the \"elements of music\" but referred to them as \"elemental components\" (p. 2). Nonetheless, these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: \"Pitch\" and \"timbre\" match exactly, \"loudness\" links with dynamics, and \"time\" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration, and tempo. This usage of the phrase \"the elements of music\" links more closely with Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary definition of an element as: \"a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods\" and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well. Although writers of lists of \"rudimentary elements of music\" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area. A slightly different way of approaching the identification of the elements of music, is to identify the \"elements of sound\" as: pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic texture and spatial location, and then to define the \"elements of music\" as: sound, structure, and artistic intent.", "It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area. A slightly different way of approaching the identification of the elements of music, is to identify the \"elements of sound\" as: pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic texture and spatial location, and then to define the \"elements of music\" as: sound, structure, and artistic intent. == Sociological aspects == Ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity. Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings from being alone, to attending a large concert, forming a music community, which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there was a divide between what types of music were viewed as \"high culture\" and \"low culture.\" \"High culture\" included Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly. Other types of music\u2014including jazz, blues, soul, and country\u2014are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may drink, dance and cheer. Until the 20th century, the division between \"high\" and \"low\" musical forms was accepted as a valid distinction that separated out \"art music\", from popular music heard in bars and dance halls.", "Other types of music\u2014including jazz, blues, soul, and country\u2014are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may drink, dance and cheer. Until the 20th century, the division between \"high\" and \"low\" musical forms was accepted as a valid distinction that separated out \"art music\", from popular music heard in bars and dance halls. Musicologists, such as David Brackett, note a \"redrawing of high-low cultural-aesthetic boundaries\" in the 20th century. And, \"when industry and public discourses link categories of music with categories of people, they tend to conflate stereotypes with actual listening communities.\" Stereotypes can be based on socioeconomic standing, or social class, of the performers or audience of the different types of music. When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be strong resistance from academics and others. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, serialism, bebop, hip hop, punk rock, and electronica were controversial and criticised, when they were first introduced. Such themes are examined in the sociology of music, sometimes called sociomusicology, which is pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to ethnomusicology. === Role of women === Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions.", "Such themes are examined in the sociology of music, sometimes called sociomusicology, which is pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to ethnomusicology. === Role of women === Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of popular music and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, rock critics and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of women composers in classical music, from the medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the commonly performed classical music repertoire, music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the Concise Oxford History of Music, Clara Schumann is one of the few female composers who is mentioned. Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and heavy metal, although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and all-female bands.", "In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and heavy metal, although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and all-female bands. Women are particularly underrepresented in extreme metal genres. In the 1960s pop-music scene, \"[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field.

While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women musicologists, women became involved in music education \"...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.\" According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's The Independent, women musicians in classical music are \"...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent\" and they face pressure \"...to look sexy onstage and in photos.\" Duchen states that while \"[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.\" According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the conductor of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.", "While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women musicologists, women became involved in music education \"...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.\" According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's The Independent, women musicians in classical music are \"...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent\" and they face pressure \"...to look sexy onstage and in photos.\" Duchen states that while \"[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.\" According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the conductor of an orchestra. In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process. One of the most recorded artists is Asha Bhosle, an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema. == Media and technology == Since the 20th century, live music can be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or recorded and listened to on a CD player or MP3 player. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as talking pictures emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work. During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and theater organists were common at first-run theaters. With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The American Federation of Musicians (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices.", "With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The American Federation of Musicians (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the Pittsburgh Press features an image of a can labeled \"Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever\" Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a disc jockey uses disc records for scratching, and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Some pop bands use recorded backing tracks. Computers and many keyboards can be programmed to produce and play Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) music. Audiences can also become performers by participating in karaoke, an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.", "Three flutes from the Geissenkl\u00f6sterle are dated as the oldest, c. 43,150\u201339,370 BP. === Antiquity === The earliest material and representational evidence of Egyptian musical instruments dates to the Predynastic period, but the evidence is more securely attested in the Old Kingdom when harps, flutes and double clarinets were played. Percussion instruments, lyres, and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Cymbals frequently accompanied music and dance, much as they still do in Egypt today. Egyptian folk music, including the traditional Sufi dhikr rituals, are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient Egyptian music, having preserved many of its features, rhythms and instruments. The \"Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal\", found on clay tablets in the ancient Syrian city of Ugarit, is the oldest surviving notated work of music, dating back to approximately 1400 BCE. Music was an important part of social and cultural life in ancient Greece, in fact it was one of the main subjects taught to children.", "Audiences can also become performers by participating in karaoke, an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks. The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via streaming video and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. Another effect of the Internet arose with online communities and social media websites like YouTube and Facebook, a social networking service. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to Don Tapscott and Anthony D.", "YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams, in their book Wikinomics, there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a \"prosumer\" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of mashes, remixes, and music videos by fans. Music streaming services have further transformed music production. Streaming platforms, such as Spotify and Apple Music, mediate how music is consumed and distributed. This raises questions about how artists market their releases (i.e. as 'limited edition'), algorithmic suggestions, and affordable access to recorded music.", "This raises questions about how artists market their releases (i.e. as 'limited edition'), algorithmic suggestions, and affordable access to recorded music. Generative AI systems, more commonly known as Music Metacreation in music generation, are increasingly being used to create music. A more neutral term is 'Music Generation Systems' (MGSs). == Education == === Non-institutional === The incorporation of music into general education from preschool to post secondary education is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, counting, listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of language, improving the ability to recall information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas. In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the recorder, sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles.", "In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the recorder, sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing hymns and other religious music. In secondary schools (but rarely in primary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as choirs (a group of singers), marching bands, concert bands, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private music lessons after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about musical notation for musical scales and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques. At the university level, students in most arts and humanities programs can receive credit for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the history of music, or a music appreciation course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles.", "Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about musical notation for musical scales and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the Indonesian Institute of the Arts in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the music of Africa or Bali (e.g. Gamelan music). === Institutional === People aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as music history professors, sound engineers, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and music conservatories.

On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., sound recording). While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as jazz or popular music musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the Manhattan School of Music and the Berklee College of Music. Two schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are McGill University and Humber College. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as heavy metal music, country music or blues are unlikely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas.", "Two schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are McGill University and Humber College. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as heavy metal music, country music or blues are unlikely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing or playing in bands (often beginning in amateur bands, cover bands and tribute bands), studying recordings on DVD and the Internet, and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal mentoring or regular music lessons. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube \"how-to\" videos have enabled singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with vocal coaches and voice teachers. == Academic study == === Musicology === Musicology, the academic study of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: systematic musicology, historical musicology, and comparative musicology or ethnomusicology. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division into music theory, music history, and ethnomusicology.", "The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: systematic musicology, historical musicology, and comparative musicology or ethnomusicology.

Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of psychoacoustics. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue study of musicology, ethnomusicology, music history, and music theory through different types of degrees, including bachelor's, master's and PhD. === Music theory === Music theory is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include mathematics, physics, and anthropology. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the common practice period, or tonal music.", "More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include mathematics, physics, and anthropology. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the common practice period, or tonal music. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take other forms. Musical set theory is the application of mathematical set theory to music, first applied to atonal music. Speculative music theory, contrasted with analytic music theory, is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example tuning systems, generally as preparation for composition. === Zoomusicology === Zoomusicology is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, \"do animals have music?\" Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che's Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion (1983), a study of \"ornitho-musicology\" using a technique of Nicolas Ruwet's Language, musique, po\u00e9sie (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that bird songs are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that \"in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin.", "As George Herzog (1941) asked, \"do animals have music?\" Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che's Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion (1983), a study of \"ornitho-musicology\" using a technique of Nicolas Ruwet's Language, musique, po\u00e9sie (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that bird songs are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that \"in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human.\" === Ethnomusicology === In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures (\"world music\" or the field of \"ethnomusicology\") is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied from culture to culture, and period to period. Different cultures emphasised different instruments, techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication.", "The \"Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal\", found on clay tablets in the ancient Syrian city of Ugarit, is the oldest surviving notated work of music, dating back to approximately 1400 BCE. Music was an important part of social and cultural life in ancient Greece, in fact it was one of the main subjects taught to children. Musical education was considered important for the development of an individual's soul. Musicians and singers played a prominent role in Greek theater, and those who received a musical education were seen as nobles and in perfect harmony (as can be read in the Republic, Plato). Mixed gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies. Instruments included the double-reed aulos and a plucked string instrument, the lyre, principally a special kind called a kithara. Music was an important part of education, and boys were taught music starting at age six. Greek musical literacy created significant musical development.", "Different cultures emphasised different instruments, techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with Chinese opera during the Cultural Revolution. There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the definition of music. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or \"art\" music), and popular music (or commercial music \u2013 including non-Western styles of rock, country, and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these \"big two\" classifications, (such as folk music, world music, or jazz-related music). As world cultures have come into greater global contact, their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States bluegrass style contains elements from Anglo-Irish, Scottish, Irish, German and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic \"melting pot\" society.", "As world cultures have come into greater global contact, their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States bluegrass style contains elements from Anglo-Irish, Scottish, Irish, German and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic \"melting pot\" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's Porgy and Bess and Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story are claimed by both opera and the Broadway musical tradition. Many music festivals for non-Western music, include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music. Indian music, for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, Hindustani, Carnatic, and Dhrupad styles.", "Indian music, for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, Hindustani, Carnatic, and Dhrupad styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in South India. == Therapy == Music therapy is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets\u2014physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual\u2014to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, support physical exercise, and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.", "It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, support physical exercise, and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities. In the 10th century, the philosopher Al-Farabi described how vocal music can stimulate the feelings and souls of listeners. Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar Robert Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy argued that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially melancholia. He noted that music has an \"excellent power ...to expel many other diseases\" and he called it \"a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy.\" He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to \"make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.\" In the Ottoman Empire, mental illnesses were treated with music. In November 2006, Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues also found that music therapy helped schizophrenic patients.", "In November 2006, Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues also found that music therapy helped schizophrenic patients. == See also == Glossary of music terminology List of musicology topics Lists of musicians Music and emotion Music archaeology \u2013 Interdisciplinary study field Music history \u2013 Academic field Music-specific disorders \u2013 Disorders relating to the perception of music == References == === Notes === === Citations === === Sources === == Further reading == == External links == Grove Music Online \u2014 online version of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

Greek musical literacy created significant musical development. Greek music theory included the Greek musical modes, that eventually became the basis for Western religious and classical music. Later, influences from the Roman Empire, Eastern Europe, and the Byzantine Empire changed Greek music. The Seikilos epitaph is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world. The oldest surviving work written about music theory is Harmonika Stoicheia by Aristoxenus. === Asian cultures === Asian music covers a swath of music cultures surveyed in the articles on Arabia, Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. These traditions, with several reaching into antiquity, share historical ties through trade, religion and philosophical exchange, yet preserve their unique local aesthetics and performance styles.", "Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of deleterious mental conditions. These include matters related to cognition, perceptions, mood, emotion, and behavior. Initial psychiatric assessment begins with taking a case history and conducting a mental status examination. Laboratory tests, physical examinations, and psychological assessments may also be used. On occasion, neuroimaging or neurophysiological studies are performed. Mental disorders are diagnosed in accordance with diagnostic manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), edited by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in May 2013. However, its release coincided with a statement by then-NIMH Director Thomas Insel noting that the manual lacks validity compared to other medical specialties due to the absence of objective laboratory measures (biomarkers) for diagnosis.", "The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in May 2013. However, its release coincided with a statement by then-NIMH Director Thomas Insel noting that the manual lacks validity compared to other medical specialties due to the absence of objective laboratory measures (biomarkers) for diagnosis. Treatment may include psychotropics (psychiatric medicines), psychotherapy, substance-abuse treatment, and other modalities such as interventional approaches, assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or risk to the individual or community. Research within psychiatry is conducted by psychiatrists on an interdisciplinary basis with other professionals, including clinical psychologists, epidemiologists, nurses, social workers, and occupational therapists. Psychiatry has been controversial since its inception, facing criticism both internally and externally over its medicalization of mental distress, reliance on pharmaceuticals, use of coercion, influence from the pharmaceutical industry, and its historical role in social control and contentious treatments. Due to the absence of objective biological pathology (such as tissue damage or biomarkers), prominent critics such as Thomas Szasz and Peter Breggin have characterized the field as a pseudoscience or a form of social control masquerading as medicine. Additionally, the 'chemical imbalance' theory used to market psychiatric drugs for decades was recently identified as empirically unsubstantiated by a major 2022 review, leading to accusations of systemic pharmaceutical marketing fraud.", "Recently, however, there has been an increase in the number of medical students entering into a psychiatry residency. There are several reasons for this surge, including the intriguing nature of the field, growing interest in genetic biomarkers involved in psychiatric diagnoses, and newer pharmaceuticals on the drug market to treat psychiatric illnesses. === Subspecialties === The field of psychiatry has many subspecialties that require additional training and certification by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN). Such subspecialties include: Addiction psychiatry, addiction medicine Brain injury medicine Child and adolescent psychiatry Consultation-liaison psychiatry Forensic psychiatry Geriatric psychiatry Hospice and palliative medicine Sleep medicine Additional psychiatry subspecialties, for which the ABPN does not provide formal certification, include: Biological psychiatry Community psychiatry Cross-cultural psychiatry Emergency psychiatry Evolutionary psychiatry Global mental health Learning disabilities Military psychiatry Neurodevelopmental disorders Neuropsychiatry Interventional Psychiatry Social psychiatry Addiction psychiatry focuses on evaluation and treatment of individuals with alcohol, drug, or other substance-related disorders, and of individuals with dual diagnosis of substance-related and other psychiatric disorders. Biological psychiatry is an approach to psychiatry that aims to understand mental disorders in terms of the biological function of the nervous system. Child and adolescent psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes in work with children, teenagers, and their families. Community psychiatry is an approach that reflects an inclusive public health perspective and is practiced in community mental health services. Cross-cultural psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry concerned with the cultural and ethnic context of mental disorder and psychiatric services.", "Community psychiatry is an approach that reflects an inclusive public health perspective and is practiced in community mental health services. Cross-cultural psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry concerned with the cultural and ethnic context of mental disorder and psychiatric services. Emergency psychiatry is the clinical application of psychiatry in emergency settings. Forensic psychiatry utilizes medical science generally, and psychiatric knowledge and assessment methods in particular, to help answer legal questions. Geriatric psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry dealing with the study, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders in the elderly. Global mental health is an area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide, although some scholars consider it to be a neo-colonial, culturally insensitive project. Liaison psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes in the interface between other medical specialties and psychiatry. Military psychiatry covers special aspects of psychiatry and mental disorders within the military context.", "Liaison psychiatry is the branch of psychiatry that specializes in the interface between other medical specialties and psychiatry. Military psychiatry covers special aspects of psychiatry and mental disorders within the military context. Neuropsychiatry is a branch of medicine dealing with mental disorders attributable to diseases of the nervous system. Social psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry that focuses on the interpersonal and cultural context of mental disorder and mental well-being. Evolutionary psychiatry (or Darwinian psychiatry) is a theoretical orientation within psychiatry that applies principles from evolutionary biology\u2014such as natural selection, adaptation, mismatch, and trade\u2010offs\u2014to frame hypotheses about the origins, persistence, and variation of mental disorders. In larger healthcare organizations, psychiatrists often serve in senior management roles, where they are responsible for the efficient and effective delivery of mental health services for the organization's constituents. For example, the Chief of Mental Health Services at most VA medical centers is usually a psychiatrist, although psychologists occasionally are selected for the position as well. In the United States, psychiatry is one of the few specialties which qualify for further education and board-certification in pain medicine, palliative medicine, and sleep medicine.", "For example, the Chief of Mental Health Services at most VA medical centers is usually a psychiatrist, although psychologists occasionally are selected for the position as well. In the United States, psychiatry is one of the few specialties which qualify for further education and board-certification in pain medicine, palliative medicine, and sleep medicine. === Research === Psychiatric research is, by its very nature, interdisciplinary; combining social, biological and psychological perspectives in attempt to understand the nature and treatment of mental disorders. Clinical and research psychiatrists study basic and clinical psychiatric topics at research institutions and publish articles in journals. Under the supervision of institutional review boards, psychiatric clinical researchers look at topics such as neuroimaging, genetics, and psychopharmacology in order to enhance diagnostic validity and reliability, to discover new treatment methods, and to classify new mental disorders. == Clinical application == === Diagnostic systems === Psychiatric diagnoses take place in a wide variety of settings and are performed by many different health professionals. Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a differential diagnosis procedure where a mental status examination and physical examination is conducted, with pathological, psychopathological or psychosocial histories obtained, and sometimes neuroimages or other neurophysiological measurements are taken, or personality tests or cognitive tests administered.", "Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a differential diagnosis procedure where a mental status examination and physical examination is conducted, with pathological, psychopathological or psychosocial histories obtained, and sometimes neuroimages or other neurophysiological measurements are taken, or personality tests or cognitive tests administered. In some cases, a brain scan might be used to rule out other medical illnesses, but at this time relying on brain scans alone cannot accurately diagnose a mental illness or tell the risk of getting a mental illness in the future. Some clinicians are beginning to utilize genetics and automated speech assessment during the diagnostic process but on the whole these remain research topics. === Potential use of MRI/fMRI in diagnosis === In 2018, the American Psychological Association commissioned a review to reach a consensus on whether modern clinical MRI/fMRI will be able to be used in the diagnosis of mental health disorders. The criteria presented by the APA stated that the biomarkers used in diagnosis should: \"have a sensitivity of at least 80% for detecting a particular psychiatric disorder\" \"should have a specificity of at least 80% for distinguishing this disorder from other psychiatric or medical disorders\" \"should be reliable, reproducible, and ideally be noninvasive, simple to perform, and inexpensive\" \"proposed biomarkers should be verified by 2 independent studies each by a different investigator and different population samples and published in a peer-reviewed journal\" The review concluded that although neuroimaging diagnosis may technically be feasible, very large studies are needed to evaluate specific biomarkers which were not available. === Diagnostic manuals === Three main diagnostic manuals used to classify mental health conditions are in use today. The ICD-11 is produced and published by the World Health Organization, includes a section on psychiatric conditions, and is used worldwide.", "=== Diagnostic manuals === Three main diagnostic manuals used to classify mental health conditions are in use today. The ICD-11 is produced and published by the World Health Organization, includes a section on psychiatric conditions, and is used worldwide. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, produced and published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), is primarily focused on mental health conditions and is the main classification tool in the United States. It is currently in its fifth revised edition and is also used worldwide. The Chinese Society of Psychiatry has also produced a diagnostic manual, the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders. The stated intention of diagnostic manuals is typically to develop replicable and clinically useful categories and criteria, to facilitate consensus and agreed upon standards, whilst being atheoretical as regards etiology. However, the categories are nevertheless based on particular psychiatric theories and data; they are broad and often specified by numerous possible combinations of symptoms, and many of the categories overlap in symptomology or typically occur together. While originally intended only as a guide for experienced clinicians trained in its use, the nomenclature is now widely used by clinicians, administrators and insurance companies in many countries.", "However, the categories are nevertheless based on particular psychiatric theories and data; they are broad and often specified by numerous possible combinations of symptoms, and many of the categories overlap in symptomology or typically occur together. While originally intended only as a guide for experienced clinicians trained in its use, the nomenclature is now widely used by clinicians, administrators and insurance companies in many countries. The DSM has attracted praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria. It has also attracted controversy and criticism. Some critics argue that the DSM represents an unscientific system that enshrines the opinions of a few powerful psychiatrists. There are ongoing issues concerning the validity and reliability of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial symptoms; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from 'normality'; possible cultural bias; medicalization of human distress and financial conflicts of interest, including with the practice of psychiatrists and with the pharmaceutical industry; political controversies about the inclusion or exclusion of diagnoses from the manual, in general or in regard to specific issues; and the experience of those who are most directly affected by the manual by being diagnosed, including the consumer/survivor movement. == Treatment == === General considerations === Individuals receiving psychiatric treatment are commonly referred to as patients but may also be called clients, consumers, or service recipients. They may come under the care of a psychiatric physician or other psychiatric practitioners by various paths, the two most common being self-referral or referral by a primary care physician.", "== Treatment == === General considerations === Individuals receiving psychiatric treatment are commonly referred to as patients but may also be called clients, consumers, or service recipients. They may come under the care of a psychiatric physician or other psychiatric practitioners by various paths, the two most common being self-referral or referral by a primary care physician. Alternatively, a person may be referred by hospital medical staff, by court order, involuntary commitment, or, in countries such as the UK and Australia, by sectioning under a mental health law. A psychiatrist or medical provider evaluates people through a psychiatric assessment for their mental and physical condition. This usually involves interviewing the person and often obtaining information from other sources such as other health and social care professionals, relatives, associates, law enforcement personnel, emergency medical personnel, and psychiatric rating scales. A mental status examination is carried out, and a physical examination is usually performed to establish or exclude other illnesses that may be contributing to the alleged psychiatric problems. A physical examination may also serve to identify any signs of self-harm; this examination is often performed by someone other than the psychiatrist, especially if blood tests and medical imaging are performed. Like most medications, psychiatric medications can cause adverse effects in patients, and some require ongoing therapeutic drug monitoring, for instance full blood counts, serum drug levels, renal function, liver function or thyroid function.", "A physical examination may also serve to identify any signs of self-harm; this examination is often performed by someone other than the psychiatrist, especially if blood tests and medical imaging are performed. Like most medications, psychiatric medications can cause adverse effects in patients, and some require ongoing therapeutic drug monitoring, for instance full blood counts, serum drug levels, renal function, liver function or thyroid function. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is sometimes administered for serious conditions, such as those unresponsive to medication. The efficacy and adverse effects of psychiatric drugs may vary from patient to patient. === Inpatient treatment === Psychiatric treatments have changed over the past several decades. In the past, psychiatric patients were often hospitalized for six months or more, with some cases involving hospitalization for many years. Average inpatient psychiatric treatment stay has decreased significantly since the 1960s, a trend known as deinstitutionalization. Today in most countries, people receiving psychiatric treatment are more likely to be seen as outpatients.", "Average inpatient psychiatric treatment stay has decreased significantly since the 1960s, a trend known as deinstitutionalization. Today in most countries, people receiving psychiatric treatment are more likely to be seen as outpatients. If hospitalization is required, the average hospital stay is around one to two weeks, with only a small number receiving long-term hospitalization. However, in Japan psychiatric hospitals continue to keep patients for long periods, sometimes even keeping them in physical restraints, strapped to their beds for periods of weeks or months. Psychiatric inpatients are people admitted to a hospital or clinic to receive psychiatric care. Some are admitted involuntarily, perhaps committed to a secure hospital, or in some jurisdictions to a facility within the prison system. In many countries including the United States and Canada, the criteria for involuntary admission vary with local jurisdiction. They may be as broad as having a mental health condition, or as narrow as being an immediate danger to themselves or others.", "Due to the absence of objective biological pathology (such as tissue damage or biomarkers), prominent critics such as Thomas Szasz and Peter Breggin have characterized the field as a pseudoscience or a form of social control masquerading as medicine. Additionally, the 'chemical imbalance' theory used to market psychiatric drugs for decades was recently identified as empirically unsubstantiated by a major 2022 review, leading to accusations of systemic pharmaceutical marketing fraud. Furthermore, the paradigm of chronic pharmaceutical maintenance has been challenged by longitudinal studies, such as the 20-year Chicago Follow-up Study (Harrow et al.), which found that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who discontinued antipsychotic medication achieved significantly higher rates of functional recovery and employment compared to those who remained medicated. == Etymology == The term psychiatry was first coined by the German physician Johann Christian Reil in 1808 and literally means the 'medical treatment of the soul' (\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae psych- 'soul' from Ancient Greek psykh\u0113 'soul'; -iatry 'medical treatment' from Gk. \u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 i\u0101trikos 'medical' from \u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 i\u0101sthai 'to heal'). A medical doctor specializing in psychiatry is a psychiatrist (for a historical overview, see: Timeline of psychiatry). == Theory and focus == Psychiatry refers to a field of medicine focused specifically on the mind, aiming to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders in humans. It has been described as an intermediary between the world from a social context and the world from the perspective of those who are mentally ill.", "In many countries including the United States and Canada, the criteria for involuntary admission vary with local jurisdiction. They may be as broad as having a mental health condition, or as narrow as being an immediate danger to themselves or others. Bed availability is often the real determinant of admission decisions to hard pressed public facilities. People may be admitted voluntarily if the treating doctor considers that safety is not compromised by this less restrictive option. For many years, controversy has surrounded the use of involuntary treatment and use of the term \"lack of insight\" in describing patients. Internationally, mental health laws vary significantly but in many cases, involuntary psychiatric treatment is permitted when there is deemed to be a significant risk to the patient or others due to the patient's illness. Involuntary treatment refers to treatment that occurs based on a treating physician's recommendations, without requiring consent from the patient. Inpatient psychiatric wards may be secure (for those thought to have a particular risk of violence or self-harm) or unlocked/open.", "Involuntary treatment refers to treatment that occurs based on a treating physician's recommendations, without requiring consent from the patient. Inpatient psychiatric wards may be secure (for those thought to have a particular risk of violence or self-harm) or unlocked/open. Some wards are mixed-sex whilst same-sex wards are increasingly favored to protect women inpatients. Once in the care of a hospital, people are assessed, monitored, and often given medication and care from a multidisciplinary team, which may include physicians, pharmacists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatric social workers, occupational therapists and social workers. If a person receiving treatment in a psychiatric hospital is assessed as at particular risk of harming themselves or others, they may be put on constant or intermittent one-to-one supervision and may be put in physical restraints or medicated. People on inpatient wards may be allowed leave for periods of time, either accompanied or on their own. In many developed countries there has been a massive reduction in psychiatric beds since the mid 20th century, with the growth of community care. Italy has been a pioneer in psychiatric reform, particularly through the no-restraint initiative that began nearly fifty years ago.", "In many developed countries there has been a massive reduction in psychiatric beds since the mid 20th century, with the growth of community care. Italy has been a pioneer in psychiatric reform, particularly through the no-restraint initiative that began nearly fifty years ago. The Italian movement, heavily influenced by Franco Basaglia, emphasizes ethical treatment and the elimination of physical restraints in psychiatric care. A study examining the application of these principles in Italy found that 14 general hospital psychiatric units reported zero restraint incidents in 2022. Standards of inpatient care remain a challenge in some public and private facilities, due to levels of funding, and facilities in developing countries are typically grossly inadequate for the same reason. Even in developed countries, programs in public hospitals vary widely. Some may offer structured activities and therapies offered from many perspectives while others may only have the funding for medicating and monitoring patients. This may be problematic in that the maximum amount of therapeutic work might not actually take place in the hospital setting.", "Some may offer structured activities and therapies offered from many perspectives while others may only have the funding for medicating and monitoring patients. This may be problematic in that the maximum amount of therapeutic work might not actually take place in the hospital setting. This is why hospitals are increasingly used in limited situations and moments of crisis where patients are a direct threat to themselves or others. Alternatives to psychiatric hospitals that may actively offer more therapeutic approaches include rehabilitation centers or \"rehab\" as popularly termed. === Outpatient treatment === Outpatient treatment involves periodic visits to a psychiatrist for consultation in his or her office, or at a community-based outpatient clinic. During initial appointments, a psychiatrist generally conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient. Follow-up appointments then focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms. The frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely, from once a week to twice a year, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best.", "Follow-up appointments then focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms. The frequency with which a psychiatrist sees people in treatment varies widely, from once a week to twice a year, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and patient decide would be best. Increasingly, psychiatrists are limiting their practices to psychopharmacology (prescribing medications), as opposed to previous practice in which a psychiatrist would provide traditional 50-minute psychotherapy sessions, of which psychopharmacology would be a part, but most of the consultation sessions consisted of \"talk therapy\". This shift began in the early 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s. A major reason for this change was the advent of managed care insurance plans, which began to limit reimbursement for psychotherapy sessions provided by psychiatrists. The underlying assumption was that psychopharmacology was at least as effective as psychotherapy, and it could be delivered more efficiently because less time is required for the appointment. Because of this shift in practice patterns, psychiatrists often refer patients whom they think would benefit from psychotherapy to other mental health professionals, e.g., clinical social workers and psychologists. === Telepsychiatry === == History == === Earliest knowledge === The earliest known texts on mental disorders are from ancient India and include the Ayurvedic text, Charaka Samhita.", "Because of this shift in practice patterns, psychiatrists often refer patients whom they think would benefit from psychotherapy to other mental health professionals, e.g., clinical social workers and psychologists. === Telepsychiatry === == History == === Earliest knowledge === The earliest known texts on mental disorders are from ancient India and include the Ayurvedic text, Charaka Samhita. The first hospitals for curing mental illness were established in India during the 3rd century BCE. Greek philosophers, including Thales, Plato, and Aristotle (especially in his De Anima treatise), also addressed the workings of the mind. As early as the 4th century BC, the Greek physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical rather than supernatural causes. In 387 BCE, Plato suggested that the brain is where mental processes take place. In 4th to 5th century B.C. Greece, Hippocrates wrote that he visited Democritus and found him in his garden cutting open animals.", "In 4th to 5th century B.C. Greece, Hippocrates wrote that he visited Democritus and found him in his garden cutting open animals. Democritus explained that he was attempting to discover the cause of madness and melancholy. Hippocrates praised his work. Democritus had with him a book on madness and melancholy. During the 5th century BCE, mental disorders, especially those with psychotic traits, were considered supernatural in origin, a view which existed throughout ancient Greece and Rome, as well as Egyptian regions. Alcmaeon, believed the brain, not the heart, was the \"organ of thought\". He tracked the ascending sensory nerves from the body to the brain, theorizing that mental activity originated in the CNS and that the cause of mental illness resided within the brain.", "Alcmaeon, believed the brain, not the heart, was the \"organ of thought\". He tracked the ascending sensory nerves from the body to the brain, theorizing that mental activity originated in the CNS and that the cause of mental illness resided within the brain. He applied this understanding to classify mental diseases and treatments. Religious leaders often turned to versions of exorcism to treat mental disorders often utilizing methods that many consider to be cruel or barbaric methods. Trepanning was one of these methods used throughout history. In the 6th century AD, Lin Xie carried out an early psychological experiment, in which he asked people to draw a square with one hand and at the same time draw a circle with the other (ostensibly to test people's vulnerability to distraction). It has been cited that this was an early psychiatric experiment. The Islamic Golden Age fostered early studies in Islamic psychology and psychiatry, with many scholars writing about mental disorders.", "It has been cited that this was an early psychiatric experiment. The Islamic Golden Age fostered early studies in Islamic psychology and psychiatry, with many scholars writing about mental disorders. The Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, also known as \"Rhazes\", wrote texts about psychiatric conditions in the 9th century. As chief physician of a hospital in Baghdad, he was also the director of one of the first bimaristans in the world. The first bimaristan was founded in Baghdad in the 9th century, and several others of increasing complexity were created throughout the Arab world in the following centuries. Some of the bimaristans contained wards dedicated to the care of mentally ill patients. During the Middle Ages, Psychiatric hospitals and lunatic asylums were built and expanded throughout Europe. Specialist hospitals such as Bethlem Royal Hospital in London were built in medieval Europe from the 13th century to treat mental disorders, but were used only as custodial institutions and did not provide any type of treatment.", "During the Middle Ages, Psychiatric hospitals and lunatic asylums were built and expanded throughout Europe. Specialist hospitals such as Bethlem Royal Hospital in London were built in medieval Europe from the 13th century to treat mental disorders, but were used only as custodial institutions and did not provide any type of treatment. It is the oldest extant psychiatric hospital in the world. An ancient text known as The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine identifies the brain as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of personality based on yin\u2013yang balance, and analyzes mental disorder in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the Qing Dynasty with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611\u20131671), Liu Zhi (1660\u20131730), and Wang Qingren (1768\u20131831). Wang Qingren emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the causes of dreams, insomnia, psychosis, depression and epilepsy. === Medical specialty === The beginning of psychiatry as a medical specialty is dated to the middle of the nineteenth century, although its germination can be traced to the late eighteenth century. In the late 17th century, privately run asylums for the insane began to proliferate and expand in size.", "== Theory and focus == Psychiatry refers to a field of medicine focused specifically on the mind, aiming to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders in humans. It has been described as an intermediary between the world from a social context and the world from the perspective of those who are mentally ill. People who specialize in psychiatry often differ from most other mental health professionals and physicians in that they must be familiar with both the social and biological sciences. The discipline studies the operations of different organs and body systems as classified by the patient's subjective experiences and the objective physiology of the patient. Psychiatry treats mental disorders, which are conventionally divided into three general categories: mental illnesses, severe learning disabilities, and personality disorders. Although the focus of psychiatry has changed little over time, the diagnostic and treatment processes have evolved dramatically and continue to do so. Since the late 20th century, the field of psychiatry has continued to become more biological and less conceptually isolated from other medical fields. === Scope of practice === Though the medical specialty of psychiatry uses research in the field of neuroscience, psychology, medicine, biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology, it has generally been considered a middle ground between neurology and psychology.", "=== Medical specialty === The beginning of psychiatry as a medical specialty is dated to the middle of the nineteenth century, although its germination can be traced to the late eighteenth century. In the late 17th century, privately run asylums for the insane began to proliferate and expand in size. In 1713, the Bethel Hospital Norwich was opened, the first purpose-built asylum in England. In 1656, Louis XIV of France created a public system of hospitals for those with mental disorders, but as in England, no real treatment was applied. During the Enlightenment, attitudes towards the mentally ill began to change. It came to be viewed as a disorder that required compassionate treatment. In 1758, English physician William Battie wrote his Treatise on Madness on the management of mental disorder. It was a critique aimed particularly at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, where a conservative regime continued to use barbaric custodial treatment.", "In 1758, English physician William Battie wrote his Treatise on Madness on the management of mental disorder. It was a critique aimed particularly at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, where a conservative regime continued to use barbaric custodial treatment. Battie argued for a tailored management of patients entailing cleanliness, good food, fresh air, and distraction from friends and family. He argued that mental disorder originated from dysfunction of the material brain and body rather than the internal workings of the mind. The introduction of moral treatment was initiated independently by the French doctor Philippe Pinel and the English Quaker William Tuke. In 1792, Pinel became the chief physician at the Bic\u00eatre Hospital. Patients were allowed to move freely about the hospital grounds, and eventually dark dungeons were replaced with sunny, well-ventilated rooms. Pinel's student and successor, Jean Esquirol (1772\u20131840), went on to help establish 10 new mental hospitals that operated on the same principles.", "Patients were allowed to move freely about the hospital grounds, and eventually dark dungeons were replaced with sunny, well-ventilated rooms. Pinel's student and successor, Jean Esquirol (1772\u20131840), went on to help establish 10 new mental hospitals that operated on the same principles. Although Tuke, Pinel and others had tried to do away with physical restraint, it remained widespread into the 19th century. At the Lincoln Asylum in England, Robert Gardiner Hill, with the support of Edward Parker Charlesworth, pioneered a mode of treatment that suited \"all types\" of patients, so that mechanical restraints and coercion could be dispensed with\u2014a situation he finally achieved in 1838. In 1839, Sergeant John Adams and Dr. John Conolly were impressed by the work of Hill, and introduced the method into their Hanwell Asylum, by then the largest in the country. The modern era of institutionalized provision for the care of the mentally ill, began in the early 19th century with a large state-led effort. In England, the Lunacy Act 1845 was an important landmark in the treatment of the mentally ill, as it explicitly changed the status of mentally ill people to patients who required treatment.", "The modern era of institutionalized provision for the care of the mentally ill, began in the early 19th century with a large state-led effort. In England, the Lunacy Act 1845 was an important landmark in the treatment of the mentally ill, as it explicitly changed the status of mentally ill people to patients who required treatment. All asylums were required to have written regulations and to have a resident qualified physician. In 1838, France enacted a law to regulate both the admissions into asylums and asylum services across the country. In the United States, the erection of state asylums began with the first law for the creation of one in New York, passed in 1842. The Utica State Hospital was opened around 1850. Many state hospitals in the United States were built in the 1850s and 1860s on the Kirkbride Plan, an architectural style meant to have curative effect. At the turn of the century, England and France combined had only a few hundred individuals in asylums.", "Many state hospitals in the United States were built in the 1850s and 1860s on the Kirkbride Plan, an architectural style meant to have curative effect. At the turn of the century, England and France combined had only a few hundred individuals in asylums. By the late 1890s and early 1900s, this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands. However, the idea that mental illness could be ameliorated through institutionalization ran into difficulties. Psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population, and asylums again became almost indistinguishable from custodial institutions. In the early 1800s, psychiatry made advances in the diagnosis of mental illness by broadening the category of mental disease to include mood disorders, in addition to disease level delusion or irrationality. The 20th century introduced a new psychiatry into the world, with different perspectives of looking at mental disorders. For Emil Kraepelin, the initial ideas behind biological psychiatry, stating that the different mental disorders are all biological in nature, evolved into a new concept of \"nerves\", and psychiatry became a rough approximation of neurology and neuropsychiatry.", "The 20th century introduced a new psychiatry into the world, with different perspectives of looking at mental disorders. For Emil Kraepelin, the initial ideas behind biological psychiatry, stating that the different mental disorders are all biological in nature, evolved into a new concept of \"nerves\", and psychiatry became a rough approximation of neurology and neuropsychiatry. Following Sigmund Freud's pioneering work, ideas stemming from psychoanalytic theory also began to take root in psychiatry. The psychoanalytic theory became popular among psychiatrists because it allowed the patients to be treated in private practices instead of warehoused in asylums. By the 1970s, however, the psychoanalytic school of thought became marginalized within the field. Biological psychiatry reemerged during this time. Psychopharmacology and neurochemistry became the integral parts of psychiatry starting with Otto Loewi's discovery of the neuromodulatory properties of acetylcholine; thus identifying it as the first-known neurotransmitter. Subsequently, it has been shown that different neurotransmitters have different and multiple functions in regulation of behaviour.", "Psychopharmacology and neurochemistry became the integral parts of psychiatry starting with Otto Loewi's discovery of the neuromodulatory properties of acetylcholine; thus identifying it as the first-known neurotransmitter. Subsequently, it has been shown that different neurotransmitters have different and multiple functions in regulation of behaviour. In a wide range of studies in neurochemistry using human and animal samples, individual differences in neurotransmitters' production, reuptake, receptors' density and locations were linked to differences in dispositions for specific psychiatric disorders. For example, the discovery of chlorpromazine's effectiveness in treating schizophrenia in 1952 revolutionized treatment of the disorder, as did lithium carbonate's ability to stabilize mood highs and lows in bipolar disorder in 1948. Psychotherapy was still utilized, but as a treatment for psychosocial issues. This proved the idea of neurochemical nature of many psychiatric disorders. Another approach to look for biomarkers of psychiatric disorders is neuroimaging that was first utilized as a tool for psychiatry in the 1980s. In 1963, US president John F.", "Another approach to look for biomarkers of psychiatric disorders is neuroimaging that was first utilized as a tool for psychiatry in the 1980s. In 1963, US president John F. Kennedy introduced legislation delegating the National Institute of Mental Health to administer Community Mental Health Centers for those being discharged from state psychiatric hospitals. Later, though, the Community Mental Health Centers focus shifted to providing psychotherapy for those with acute but less serious mental disorders. Ultimately there were no arrangements made for actively following and treating severely mentally ill patients who were being discharged from hospitals, resulting in a large population of chronically homeless people with mental illness. == Controversy and criticism == The institution of psychiatry has attracted controversy since its inception. Scholars including those from social psychiatry, psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, and critical psychiatry have produced critiques. It has been argued that psychiatry confuses disorders of the mind with disorders of the brain that can be treated with drugs; that its use of drugs is in part due to lobbying by drug companies resulting in distortion of research; and that the concept of \"mental illness\" is often used to label and control those with beliefs and behaviours that the majority of people disagree with; and that it is too influenced by ideas from medicine causing it to misunderstand the nature of mental distress.", "Scholars including those from social psychiatry, psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, and critical psychiatry have produced critiques.

The scientific validity of psychiatric diagnosis has been challenged due to the lack of objective biological markers. In 2013, Thomas Insel, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), stated that the DSM lacks validity because diagnoses are based on consensus rather than objective laboratory measures. Critique of psychiatry from within the field comes from the critical psychiatry group in the UK. Double argues that most critical psychiatry is anti-reductionist. Rashed argues new mental health science has moved beyond this reductionist critique by seeking integrative and biopsychosocial models for conditions and that much of critical psychiatry now exists with orthodox psychiatry but notes that many critiques remain unaddressed. The term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and was later made popular by Thomas Szasz.", "Rashed argues new mental health science has moved beyond this reductionist critique by seeking integrative and biopsychosocial models for conditions and that much of critical psychiatry now exists with orthodox psychiatry but notes that many critiques remain unaddressed. The term anti-psychiatry was coined by psychiatrist David Cooper in 1967 and was later made popular by Thomas Szasz. The word Antipsychiatrie was already used in Germany in 1904. The basic premise of the anti-psychiatry movement is that psychiatrists attempt to classify \"normal\" people as \"deviant\"; psychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients; and psychiatry's history involves (what may now be seen as) dangerous treatments, such as psychosurgery, an example of this being the frontal lobectomy (commonly called a lobotomy). The use of lobotomies largely disappeared by the late 1970s. == See also == == Notes == == References == === Citations === === Sources === == Further reading ==", "Since the late 20th century, the field of psychiatry has continued to become more biological and less conceptually isolated from other medical fields. === Scope of practice === Though the medical specialty of psychiatry uses research in the field of neuroscience, psychology, medicine, biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology, it has generally been considered a middle ground between neurology and psychology. Because psychiatry and neurology are deeply intertwined medical specialties, all certification in the United States for both specialties and for their subspecialties is offered by a single board, the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, one of the member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties. Unlike other physicians and neurologists, psychiatrists specialize in the doctor\u2013patient relationship and are trained to varying extents in the use of psychotherapy and other therapeutic communication techniques. Psychiatrists also differ from psychologists in that they are physicians and have post-graduate training called residency (usually four to five years) in psychiatry; the quality and thoroughness of their graduate medical training is identical to that of all other physicians. Psychiatrists can therefore counsel patients, prescribe medication, order laboratory tests, order neuroimaging, and conduct physical examinations. As well, some psychiatrists are trained in interventional psychiatry and can deliver interventional treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation and ketamine. === Ethics === The World Psychiatric Association issues an ethical code to govern the conduct of psychiatrists (like other purveyors of professional ethics).", "As well, some psychiatrists are trained in interventional psychiatry and can deliver interventional treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation and ketamine. === Ethics === The World Psychiatric Association issues an ethical code to govern the conduct of psychiatrists (like other purveyors of professional ethics). The psychiatric code of ethics, first set forth through the Declaration of Hawaii in 1977 has been expanded through a 1983 Vienna update and in the broader Madrid Declaration in 1996. The code was further revised during the organization's general assemblies in 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2011. The World Psychiatric Association code covers such matters as confidentiality, the death penalty, ethnic or cultural discrimination, euthanasia, genetics, the human dignity of incapacitated patients, media relations, organ transplantation, patient assessment, research ethics, sex selection, coercion, torture, and up-to-date knowledge. In establishing such ethical codes, the profession has responded to a number of controversies about the practice of psychiatry, for example, surrounding the use of lobotomy and electroconvulsive therapy. Discredited psychiatrists who operated outside the norms of medical ethics include Harry Bailey, Donald Ewen Cameron, Samuel A. Cartwright, Henry Cotton, and Andrei Snezhnevsky.", "Discredited psychiatrists who operated outside the norms of medical ethics include Harry Bailey, Donald Ewen Cameron, Samuel A. Cartwright, Henry Cotton, and Andrei Snezhnevsky. === Approaches === Psychiatric illnesses can be conceptualised in a number of different ways. The biomedical approach examines signs and symptoms and compares them with diagnostic criteria. Mental illness can be assessed, conversely, through a narrative which tries to incorporate symptoms into a meaningful life history and to frame them as responses to external conditions. Both approaches are important in the field of psychiatry but have not sufficiently reconciled to settle controversy over either the selection of a psychiatric paradigm or the specification of psychopathology. The notion of a \"biopsychosocial model\" is often used to underline the multifactorial nature of clinical impairment. In this notion the word model is not used in a strictly scientific way though.", "The notion of a \"biopsychosocial model\" is often used to underline the multifactorial nature of clinical impairment. In this notion the word model is not used in a strictly scientific way though. Alternatively, Niall McLaren acknowledges the physiological basis for the mind's existence but identifies cognition as an irreducible and independent realm in which disorder may occur. The biocognitive approach includes a mentalist etiology and provides a natural dualist (i.e., non-spiritual) revision of the biopsychosocial view, reflecting the efforts of Australian psychiatrist Niall McLaren to bring the discipline into scientific maturity in accordance with the paradigmatic standards of philosopher Thomas Kuhn. Once a medical professional diagnoses a patient there are numerous ways that they could choose to treat the patient. Often psychiatrists will develop a treatment strategy that incorporates different facets of different approaches into one. Drug prescriptions are very commonly written to be regimented to patients along with any therapy they receive. There are three major pillars of psychotherapy that treatment strategies are most regularly drawn from.", "Drug prescriptions are very commonly written to be regimented to patients along with any therapy they receive. There are three major pillars of psychotherapy that treatment strategies are most regularly drawn from. Humanistic psychology attempts to put the \"whole\" of the patient in perspective; it also focuses on self exploration. Behaviorism is a therapeutic school of thought that elects to focus solely on real and observable events, rather than mining the unconscious or subconscious. Psychoanalysis, on the other hand, concentrates its dealings on early childhood, irrational drives, the unconscious, and conflict between conscious and unconscious streams. === Practitioners === All physicians can diagnose mental disorders and prescribe treatments utilizing principles of psychiatry. Psychiatrists are trained physicians who specialize in psychiatry and are certified to treat mental illness. They may treat outpatients, inpatients, or both; they may practice as solo practitioners or as members of groups; they may be self-employed, be members of partnerships, or be employees of governmental, academic, nonprofit, or for-profit entities; employees of hospitals; they may treat military personnel as civilians or as members of the military; and in any of these settings they may function as clinicians, researchers, teachers, or some combination of these.", "Psychiatrists are trained physicians who specialize in psychiatry and are certified to treat mental illness.

Although psychiatrists may also go through significant training to conduct psychotherapy, psychoanalysis or cognitive behavioral therapy, it is their training as physicians that differentiates them from other mental health professionals. ==== As a career choice in the US ==== Psychiatry was not a popular career choice among medical students, even though medical school placements are rated favorably. This has resulted in a significant shortage of psychiatrists in the United States and elsewhere. Strategies to address this shortfall have included the use of short 'taster' placements early in the medical school curriculum and attempts to extend psychiatry services further using telemedicine technologies and other methods. Recently, however, there has been an increase in the number of medical students entering into a psychiatry residency. There are several reasons for this surge, including the intriguing nature of the field, growing interest in genetic biomarkers involved in psychiatric diagnoses, and newer pharmaceuticals on the drug market to treat psychiatric illnesses.", "Social behavior is behavior among two or more organisms within the same species, it encompasses any behavior in which one member affects another. Social behavior can be seen as similar to an exchange of goods, with the expectation that when you give, you will receive something similar in return. This behavior can be affected by both the qualities of the individual and the environmental (situational) factors. Therefore, social behavior arises as a result of an interaction between the two\u2014the organism and its environment. This means that, in regards to humans, social behavior can be determined by both the individual characteristics of the person, and the situation they are in. A major aspect of social behavior is communication, which is the basis for survival and reproduction. Social behavior is said to be determined by two different processes, that can either work together or oppose one another. The dual-systems model of reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior came out of the realization that behavior cannot just be determined by one single factor.", "Social behavior is said to be determined by two different processes, that can either work together or oppose one another. The dual-systems model of reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior came out of the realization that behavior cannot just be determined by one single factor. Instead, behavior can arise by those consciously behaving (where there is an awareness and intent), or by pure impulse. These factors that determine behavior can work in different situations and moments, and can even oppose one another. While at times one can behave with a specific goal in mind, other times they can behave without rational control, and driven by impulse instead. There are also distinctions between different types of social behavior, such as mundane versus defensive social behavior. Mundane social behavior is a result of interactions in day-to-day life, and are behaviors learned as one is exposed to those different situations. On the other hand, defensive behavior arises out of impulse, when one is faced with conflicting desires.", "Serotonin has also been associated with social confidence. === Genetics === == Affect == Positive affect (emotion) has been seen to have a large impact on social behavior, particularly by inducing more helping behavior, cooperation, and sociability. Studies have shown that even subtly inducing positive affect within individuals caused greater social behavior and helping. This phenomenon, however, is not one-directional. Just as positive affect can influence social behavior, social behavior can have an influence on positive affect. == Electronic media == Social behavior has typically been seen as a changing of behaviors relevant to the situation at hand, acting appropriately with the setting one is in. However, with the advent of electronic media, people began to find themselves in situations they may have not been exposed to in everyday life. Novel situations and information presented through electronic media has formed interactions that are completely new to people.", "However, with the advent of electronic media, people began to find themselves in situations they may have not been exposed to in everyday life. Novel situations and information presented through electronic media has formed interactions that are completely new to people. While people typically behaved in line with their setting in face-to-face interaction, the lines have become blurred when it comes to electronic media. This has led to a cascade of results, as gender norms started to merge, and people were coming in contact with information they had never been exposed to through face-to-face interaction. A political leader could no longer tailor a speech to just one audience, for their speech would be translated and heard by anyone through the media. People can no longer play drastically different roles when put in different situations, because the situations overlap more as information is more readily available. Communication flows more quickly and fluidly through media, causing behavior to merge accordingly. Media has also been shown to have an impact on promoting different types of social behavior, such as prosocial and aggressive behavior.", "Communication flows more quickly and fluidly through media, causing behavior to merge accordingly. Media has also been shown to have an impact on promoting different types of social behavior, such as prosocial and aggressive behavior. For example, violence shown through the media has been seen to lead to more aggressive behavior in its viewers. Research has also been done investigating how media portraying positive social acts, prosocial behavior, could lead to more helping behavior in its viewers. The general learning model was established to study how this process of translating media into behavior works, and why. This model suggests a link between positive media with prosocial behavior and violent media with aggressive behavior, and posits that this is mediated by the characteristics of the individual watching along with the situation they are in. This model also presents the notion that when one is exposed to the same type of media for long periods of time, this could even lead to changes within their personality traits, as they are forming different sets of knowledge and may be behaving accordingly. In various studies looking specifically at how video games with prosocial content effect behavior, it was shown that exposure influenced subsequent helping behavior in the video-game player.", "This model also presents the notion that when one is exposed to the same type of media for long periods of time, this could even lead to changes within their personality traits, as they are forming different sets of knowledge and may be behaving accordingly. In various studies looking specifically at how video games with prosocial content effect behavior, it was shown that exposure influenced subsequent helping behavior in the video-game player. The processes that underlay this effect point to prosocial thoughts being more readily available after playing a video game related to this, and thus the person playing the game is more likely to behave accordingly. These effects were not only found with video games, but also with music, as people listening to songs involving aggression and violence in the lyrics were more likely to act in an aggressive manner. Likewise, people listening to songs related to prosocial acts (relative to a song with neutral lyrics) were shown to express greater helping behaviors and more empathy afterwards. When these songs were played at restaurants, it even led to an increase in tips given (relative to those who heard neutral lyrics). == Individual and group behavior == Conformity refers to the behavior that an individual is unconsciously pressured by the group to make his behavior tend to be consistent with the majority of people in the group. Generally speaking, the larger the group size, the easier it is for individuals to display conformity behaviors.", "== Individual and group behavior == Conformity refers to the behavior that an individual is unconsciously pressured by the group to make his behavior tend to be consistent with the majority of people in the group. Generally speaking, the larger the group size, the easier it is for individuals to display conformity behaviors. Individuals may submit to the group for two reasons: first, to gain acceptance from the group (normative social influence); second, to obtain important information for the group (informational social influence). == Aggressive and violent behavior == Aggression is an important social behavior that can have both negative consequences (in a social interaction) and adaptive consequences (adaptive in humans and other primates for survival). There are many differences in aggressive behavior, and a lot of these differences are sex-difference based. == Verbal, coverbal, and nonverbal social behavior == === Verbal and coverbal behaviors === Although most animals can communicate nonverbally, humans have the ability to communicate with both verbal and nonverbal behavior. Verbal behavior is the content of one's spoken word. Verbal and nonverbal behavior intersect in what is known as coverbal behavior, which is nonverbal behavior that contributes to the meaning of verbal speech (i.e.", "Verbal behavior is the content of one's spoken word. Verbal and nonverbal behavior intersect in what is known as coverbal behavior, which is nonverbal behavior that contributes to the meaning of verbal speech (i.e. hand gestures used to emphasize the importance of what someone is saying). Although the spoken words convey meaning in and of themselves, one cannot dismiss the coverbal behaviors that accompany the words, as they place great emphasis on the thought and importance contributing to the verbal speech. Therefore, the verbal behaviors and gestures that accompany it work together to make up a conversation. Although many have posited this idea that nonverbal behavior accompanying speech serves an important role in communication, it is important to note that not all researchers agree. However, in most literature on gestures, unlike body language, gestures can accompany speech in ways that bring inner thoughts to life (often thoughts unable to be expressed verbally). Gestures (coverbal behaviors) and speech occur simultaneously, and develop along the same trajectory within children as well.", "However, in most literature on gestures, unlike body language, gestures can accompany speech in ways that bring inner thoughts to life (often thoughts unable to be expressed verbally). Gestures (coverbal behaviors) and speech occur simultaneously, and develop along the same trajectory within children as well. === Nonverbal behaviors === Behaviors that include any change in facial expression or body movement constitute the meaning of nonverbal behavior. Communicative nonverbal behavior include facial and body expressions that are intentionally meant to convey a message to those who are meant to receive it. Nonverbal behavior can serve a specific purpose (i.e. to convey a message), or can be more of an impulse/reflex. Paul Ekman, an influential psychologist, investigated both verbal and nonverbal behavior (and their role in communication) a great deal, emphasizing how difficult it is to empirically test such behaviors. Nonverbal cues can serve the function of conveying a message, thought, or emotion both to the person viewing the behavior and the person sending these cues.", "Paul Ekman, an influential psychologist, investigated both verbal and nonverbal behavior (and their role in communication) a great deal, emphasizing how difficult it is to empirically test such behaviors. Nonverbal cues can serve the function of conveying a message, thought, or emotion both to the person viewing the behavior and the person sending these cues. == Disorders involving impairments in social behavior == A number of mental disorders affect social behavior. Social anxiety disorder is a phobic disorder characterized by a fear of being judged by others, which manifests itself as a fear of people in general. Due to this pervasive fear of embarrassing oneself in front of others, it causes those affected to avoid interactions with other people. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder mainly identified by its symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Hyperactivity-Impulsivity may lead to hampered social interactions, as one who displays these symptoms may be socially intrusive, unable to maintain personal space, and talk over others. The majority of children that display symptoms of ADHD also have problems with their social behavior.", "Hyperactivity-Impulsivity may lead to hampered social interactions, as one who displays these symptoms may be socially intrusive, unable to maintain personal space, and talk over others. The majority of children that display symptoms of ADHD also have problems with their social behavior. Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the functioning of social interaction and communication. Autistic people may have difficulties in understanding social cues and the emotional states of others. Learning disabilities are often defined as a specific deficit in academic achievement; however, research has shown that with a learning disability can come social skill deficits as well. == See also == Aggression Health behavior Collective animal behavior Expectancy challenge sociological method Herd behavior Social behavior in education Social learning theory Social science Sociality Socialization Violent Behavior == References ==", "Mundane social behavior is a result of interactions in day-to-day life, and are behaviors learned as one is exposed to those different situations. On the other hand, defensive behavior arises out of impulse, when one is faced with conflicting desires. == Development == Social behavior constantly changes as one continues to grow and develop, reaching different stages of life. The development of behavior is deeply tied with the biological and cognitive changes one is experiencing at any given time. This creates general patterns of social behavior development in humans. Just as social behavior is influenced by both the situation and an individual's characteristics, the development of behavior is due to the combination of the two as well\u2014the temperament of the child along with the settings they are exposed to. Culture (parents and individuals that influence socialization in children) play a large role in the development of a child's social behavior, as the parents or caregivers are typically those who decide the settings and situations that the child is exposed to. These various settings the child is placed in (for example, the playground and classroom) form habits of interaction and behavior insomuch as the child being exposed to certain settings more frequently than others.", "Culture (parents and individuals that influence socialization in children) play a large role in the development of a child's social behavior, as the parents or caregivers are typically those who decide the settings and situations that the child is exposed to. These various settings the child is placed in (for example, the playground and classroom) form habits of interaction and behavior insomuch as the child being exposed to certain settings more frequently than others. What takes particular precedence in the influence of the setting are the people that the child must interact with their age, sex, and at times culture. Emotions also play a large role in the development of social behavior, as they are intertwined with the way an individual behaves. Through social interactions, emotion is understood through various verbal and nonverbal displays, and thus plays a large role in communication. Many of the processes that occur in the brain and underlay emotion often greatly correlate with the processes that are needed for social behavior as well. A major aspect of interaction is understanding how the other person thinks and feels, and being able to detect emotional states becomes necessary for individuals to effectively interact with one another and behave socially. As the child continues to gain social information, their behavior develops accordingly.", "A major aspect of interaction is understanding how the other person thinks and feels, and being able to detect emotional states becomes necessary for individuals to effectively interact with one another and behave socially. As the child continues to gain social information, their behavior develops accordingly. One must learn how to behave according to the interactions and people relevant to a certain setting, and therefore begin to intuitively know the appropriate form of social interaction depending on the situation. Therefore, behavior is constantly changing as required, and maturity brings this on. A child must learn to balance their own desires with those of the people they interact with, and this ability to correctly respond to contextual cues and understand the intentions and desires of another person improves with age. That being said, the individual characteristics of the child (their temperament) is important to understanding how the individual learns social behaviors and cues given to them, and this learnability is not consistent across all children. === Patterns of development across the lifespan === When studying patterns of biological development across the human lifespan, there are certain patterns that are well-maintained across humans. These patterns can often correspond with social development, and biological changes lead to respective changes in interactions.", "=== Patterns of development across the lifespan === When studying patterns of biological development across the human lifespan, there are certain patterns that are well-maintained across humans. These patterns can often correspond with social development, and biological changes lead to respective changes in interactions. In pre and post-natal infancy, the behavior of the infant is correlated with that of the caregiver. The development of social behavior is influenced by their mothers' reactions to children's emotional displays. In infancy, there is already a development of the awareness of a stranger, in which case the individual is able to identify and distinguish between people. Come childhood, the individual begins to attend more to their peers, and communication begins to take a verbal form. One also begins to classify themselves on the basis of their gender and other qualities salient about themselves, like race and age. When the child reaches school age, one typically becomes more aware of the structure of society in regards to gender, and how their own gender plays a role in this.", "One also begins to classify themselves on the basis of their gender and other qualities salient about themselves, like race and age. When the child reaches school age, one typically becomes more aware of the structure of society in regards to gender, and how their own gender plays a role in this. They become more and more reliant on verbal forms of communication, and more likely to form groups and become aware of their own role within the group. By puberty, general relations among same and opposite sex individuals are much more salient, and individuals begin to behave according to the norms of these situations. With increasing awareness of their sex and stereotypes that go along with it, the individual begins to choose how much they align with these stereotypes, and behaves either according to those stereotypes or not. This is also the time that individuals more often form sexual pairs. Once the individual reaches child rearing age, one must begin to undergo changes within the own behavior in accordance to major life-changes of a developing family. The potential new child requires the parent to modify their behavior to accommodate a new member of the family.", "Once the individual reaches child rearing age, one must begin to undergo changes within the own behavior in accordance to major life-changes of a developing family. The potential new child requires the parent to modify their behavior to accommodate a new member of the family. Come senescence and retirement, behavior is more stable as the individual has often established their social circle (whatever it may be) and is more committed to their social structure. == Neural and biological correlates == === Neural correlates === With the advent of the field social cognitive neuroscience came interest in studying social behavior's correlates within the brain to see what is happening beneath the surface as organisms act in a social manner. Although there is debate on which particular regions of the brain are responsible for social behavior, some have claimed that the paracingulate cortex is activated when one person is thinking about the motives or aims of another, a means of understanding the social world and behaving accordingly. The medial prefrontal lobe has also been seen to have activation during social cognition Research has discovered through studies on rhesus monkeys that the amygdala, a region known for expressing fear, was activated specifically when the monkeys were faced with a social situation they had never encountered before. This region of the brain was shown to be sensitive to the fear that comes with a novel social situation, inhibiting social interaction. Another form of studying the brain regions that may be responsible for social behavior has been through looking at patients with brain injuries who have an impairment in social behavior.", "This region of the brain was shown to be sensitive to the fear that comes with a novel social situation, inhibiting social interaction. Another form of studying the brain regions that may be responsible for social behavior has been through looking at patients with brain injuries who have an impairment in social behavior. Lesions in the prefrontal cortex that occurred in adulthood can affect the functioning of social behavior. When these lesions or a dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex occur in infancy/early on in life, the development of proper moral and social behavior is effected and thus atypical. === Biological correlates === Along with neural correlates, research has investigated what happens within the body (and potentially modulates) social behavior. Vasopressin is a posterior pituitary hormone that is seen to potentially play a role in affiliation for young rats. Along with young rats, vasopressin has also been associated with paternal behavior in prairie voles. Efforts have been made to connect animal research to humans, and found that vasopressin may play a role in the social responses of males in human research.", "Along with young rats, vasopressin has also been associated with paternal behavior in prairie voles. Efforts have been made to connect animal research to humans, and found that vasopressin may play a role in the social responses of males in human research. Oxytocin has also been seen to be correlated with positive social behavior, and elevated levels have been shown to potentially help improve social behavior that may have been suppressed due to stress. Thus, targeting levels of oxytocin may play a role in interventions of disorders that deal with atypical social behavior. Along with vasopressin, serotonin has also been inspected in relation to social behavior in humans. It was found to be associated with human feelings of social connection, and there is a drop in serotonin when one is socially isolated or has feelings of social isolation. Serotonin has also been associated with social confidence. === Genetics === == Affect == Positive affect (emotion) has been seen to have a large impact on social behavior, particularly by inducing more helping behavior, cooperation, and sociability.", "Social psychiatry is a branch of psychiatry that studies how the social environment impacts mental health and mental illness. It applies a cultural and societal lens on mental health by focusing on mental illness prevention, community-based care, mental health policy, and societal impact of mental health. It is closely related to cultural psychiatry and community psychiatry. Social psychiatry research is interdisciplinary by nature. It takes an epidemiological research approach and involves collaboration between psychiatrists and social scientists across sociology, anthropology, and social psychology. It has been associated with the development of community-based care and therapeutic communities, and emphasizes the effect of socioeconomic factors on mental illness. Social psychiatry can be contrasted with biopsychiatry, which focuses on genetics, brain neurochemistry and medication. Social psychiatry has influenced U.S.", "Social psychiatry can be contrasted with biopsychiatry, which focuses on genetics, brain neurochemistry and medication. Social psychiatry has influenced U.S. social policy and social movements, including the community mental health movement and the era of deinstitutionalization. == History == === Early 20th century === The term \"social psychiatry\" can be traced back to 1903 in a paper by German psychiatrist Georg Ilberg, 'Soziale Psychiatrie.' In it, Ilberg defined social psychiatry as factors that affect the mental health of populations and ways in which to prevent mental illness among society. Ilberg argued that there were many factors that influenced mental health, but the majority of mental illnesses were hereditary. In 1911, German psychiatrist Max Fischer defined social psychiatry as \"the act of providing psychiatric care outside of asylums\", and advocated for the creation of welfare centers to deliver psychiatric care outside of asylums. At this time in Germany, social psychiatry emphasized protection of the general public of those who are mentally ill and 'antisocial.' ==== United States mental health community movement ==== The mental hygiene movement in the United States marked a shift from individual responsibility of mental health to how public health and society could promote mental health. In 1909, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now called Mental Health America) was created to focus on mental illness prevention and mental health promotion.", "Sullivan proposed that personality develops through relationships and that disruptions in these interactions often underlie psychological distress. He introduced the idea that the \"self\" is shaped by social experiences and outlined a developmental framework linking psychological well-being to navigating interpersonal challenges at different life stages, such as trust in infancy and intimacy in adolescence. Interpersonal theory helped advance social psychiatry by emphasizing the significance of social and interpersonal factors in mental health, shifting the focus from purely biological explanations to a more holistic understanding of mental illness. By incorporating interpersonal dynamics and social influences into psychiatric theory, Sullivan shifted the field toward a more holistic understanding of mental health, paving the way for innovations such as family therapy, community mental health programs, and the exploration of social determinants of health. === Biopsychosocial model === The biopsychosocial model, developed by George Engel in 1977, integrates biological, psychological, and social factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of mental health. Social psychiatry builds on this framework to design interventions around community-based care and mental illness prevention. === Social determinants of mental health === Social psychiatry emphasizes how different societal and environmental factors influence mental health and contribute to psychiatric disorders. Below are some of the core factors the field has identified.", "=== Social determinants of mental health === Social psychiatry emphasizes how different societal and environmental factors influence mental health and contribute to psychiatric disorders. Below are some of the core factors the field has identified. ==== Housing and urbanization ==== Housing is recognized as a fundamental determinant of mental health, serving as both a basic human need and a stabilizing factor in people's lives. Social psychiatry attributes those with housing instability, such as frequent moves, evictions, or homelessness, generates stress, disrupts social support networks, with higher risk of psychiatric disorders. Poor living conditions, including overcrowding, unsafe environments, and exposure to hazards like mold or lead, further exacerbate mental health challenges, particularly in children. Residential segregation, often resulting from systemic issues like redlining and gentrification, concentrates marginalized communities in under-resourced areas, perpetuating mental health disparities. Conversely, stable and affordable housing provides psychological safety, fostering a sense of control and security that protects mental well-being. ==== Poverty ==== Social psychiatry views poverty as a critical determinant of mental health, emphasizing its role in creating chronic stress, limited access to resources, and systemic barriers to care.", "Conversely, stable and affordable housing provides psychological safety, fostering a sense of control and security that protects mental well-being. ==== Poverty ==== Social psychiatry views poverty as a critical determinant of mental health, emphasizing its role in creating chronic stress, limited access to resources, and systemic barriers to care. Research has shown that these barriers can generate psychological distress and increase vulnerability to conditions like depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Poverty often leads to social isolation, a key topic in social psychiatry. Faris and Dunham's 1939 study was among the first to identify social isolation as a determinant to mental health. Children in poverty, social psychiatry argues, can have developmental impacts and are associated with higher risk for adverse mental health outcomes. In the medical community, poverty is considered an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE). ==== Class and socioeconomic status ==== Social psychiatry examines class and socioeconomic status (SES) as factors that shape mental health by influencing access to power, privilege, and resources.", "In the medical community, poverty is considered an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE). ==== Class and socioeconomic status ==== Social psychiatry examines class and socioeconomic status (SES) as factors that shape mental health by influencing access to power, privilege, and resources. Research shows that employment instability, low-paying jobs, and poor working conditions are linked to higher rates of psychological distress. In his book The Impact of Inequality: How to Make Sick Societies Healthier, British epidemiologist Richard G. Wilkinson outlines how lower-class individuals can experience \"status anxiety\" or humiliation tied to social stratification, which impacts mental health. Class disparities can also shape perceptions and treatment of mental illness, with working-class populations often encountering greater stigma and fewer resources. Social psychiatry also emphasizes the importance of intersectionality; the interplay of class, race, and gender can amplify risks for mental illness. ==== Education ==== Social psychiatry views education as both a pathway to improved mental health and a source of stress or inequity.", "Social psychiatry also emphasizes the importance of intersectionality; the interplay of class, race, and gender can amplify risks for mental illness. ==== Education ==== Social psychiatry views education as both a pathway to improved mental health and a source of stress or inequity. Higher levels of education often correlate with better mental health outcomes due to increased economic opportunities, problem-solving skills, and social mobility. A 2022 study, \"Mental health effects of education\", found that an extra year of education was associated with lower rates of depression and anxiety among high school students, highlighting that the impact was even stronger for women and individuals in rural communities. According to social psychiatry, disparities in educational quality and access mirror broader socioeconomic and racial inequities, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage that affect mental health. Negative school environments\u2014characterized by bullying, exclusion, or lack of culturally responsive curricula\u2014can harm students' mental well-being, particularly those from minority or marginalized groups. ==== Race and ethnicity ==== Social psychiatrists have done research on how race and ethnicity influences mental health, particularly in the context of systemic racism, migration, immigration, and globalization. Experiences of discrimination and institutional bias in areas like housing, employment, and healthcare contribute to chronic stress and poorer mental health outcomes for marginalized racial groups.", "==== Race and ethnicity ==== Social psychiatrists have done research on how race and ethnicity influences mental health, particularly in the context of systemic racism, migration, immigration, and globalization. Experiences of discrimination and institutional bias in areas like housing, employment, and healthcare contribute to chronic stress and poorer mental health outcomes for marginalized racial groups. Immigrants and racial minorities may also face acculturation stress and identity conflicts, further affecting their mental well-being. However, some communities develop strong cultural or social bonds that act as protective factors against the effects of racism, a key area of interest in social psychiatry. Racial disparities in mental health care access, often influenced by cultural stigma, exacerbate untreated conditions and highlight the need for culturally informed interventions. Social psychiatry leverages these insights to advocate for policies that promote housing security, equitable education, anti-discrimination measures, and economic redistribution. These systemic changes aim to address the root causes of mental health disparities and improve overall population mental health. ==== Gender ==== Epidemiological studies have consistently found that women experience more mental health disorders compared to men.", "These systemic changes aim to address the root causes of mental health disparities and improve overall population mental health. ==== Gender ==== Epidemiological studies have consistently found that women experience more mental health disorders compared to men. Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and eating disorders are among the mental health disorders women experience at a higher frequency than men. The American Psychiatric Association attributes some of these to higher social risk factors. Women experience more poverty compared to men, they are more likely to be victims of violence, and they earn less income than men. === The Stress-Vulnerability Model === The Stress-Vulnerability Model explains the development and progression of mental health disorders as a result of an interaction between an individual's biological or psychological vulnerabilities and external stressors. Vulnerabilities can include genetic predispositions, neurobiological abnormalities, or personality traits, while stressors refer to environmental and social factors such as trauma, poverty, discrimination, or interpersonal conflict. The model outlines how mental health problems progress to full-blown disorders when stressors exceed an individual's coping resources and resilience.", "Vulnerabilities can include genetic predispositions, neurobiological abnormalities, or personality traits, while stressors refer to environmental and social factors such as trauma, poverty, discrimination, or interpersonal conflict. The model outlines how mental health problems progress to full-blown disorders when stressors exceed an individual's coping resources and resilience. In social psychiatry, the Stress-Vulnerability Model provides a framework for understanding how social and environmental factors contribute to mental illness. This perspective shifts the focus from purely biological causes to the broader social context, recognizing that reducing external stressors and enhancing social support can mitigate mental health risks. === Community-based care and prevention === Social psychiatry advocates for community-based care and preventive measures to address mental health issues, rather than solely relying on traditional hospital-based care. Public policy analyst Gerald Caplan laid the foundation for preventative mental health care in his 1964 book, Principles of Preventative Psychiatry, where he argues that early intervention in community settings can reduce mental illness stigma and promote mental health. By shifting the focus from individual pathology to the social context, community-based care promotes recovery, reduces stigma, and improves overall well-being. Community-based care offers a range of services, including early intervention, crisis intervention, medication management, therapy, and rehabilitation.", "By shifting the focus from individual pathology to the social context, community-based care promotes recovery, reduces stigma, and improves overall well-being. Community-based care offers a range of services, including early intervention, crisis intervention, medication management, therapy, and rehabilitation. These services are delivered in various settings, such as clinics, schools, workplaces, and community centers. By providing accessible and culturally competent care, community-based programs aim to reduce disparities in mental health care and improve outcomes for individuals with mental illness. These programs often involve collaboration between healthcare providers, social workers, educators, and community members to create supportive environments and empower individuals to build resilience. === Cultural norms, values, and beliefs === Social psychiatry acknowledges that cultural norms, values, and beliefs shape the expression, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses. This perspective advocates for culturally competent care to adjust for biases in psychiatry and public health services. In this sense, social psychiatry mirrors cultural psychiatry by emphasizing how mental illnesses and psychiatric disorders vary across cultural contexts.", "This perspective advocates for culturally competent care to adjust for biases in psychiatry and public health services. In this sense, social psychiatry mirrors cultural psychiatry by emphasizing how mental illnesses and psychiatric disorders vary across cultural contexts. Cultural psychiatry outlines how different cultures view mental health differently and how that impacts people from seeking help. === Social network and social support theories === Social psychiatry believes that social networks, support, and communities positively influence mental health and wellbeing. Leveraging social network theory and social support models, it emphasizes the importance of fostering strong social ties and support systems to increase resilience and wellbeing. The field focuses on the negative effects of social isolation, as well, arguing that social isolation is a key contributor to mental illnesses. This phenomenon, social psychiatrists argue, is closely tied to poverty and urbanization. == Research == Social psychiatry integrates different social factors of mental health to advocate for systemic changes, such as improving living conditions, addressing discrimination, and ensuring equitable access to mental health care.", "At this time in Germany, social psychiatry emphasized protection of the general public of those who are mentally ill and 'antisocial.' ==== United States mental health community movement ==== The mental hygiene movement in the United States marked a shift from individual responsibility of mental health to how public health and society could promote mental health. In 1909, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now called Mental Health America) was created to focus on mental illness prevention and mental health promotion. In 1915, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene administered a series of social surveys that explored mental illness outside of asylums and institutions. These surveys uncovered the extent of mental health challenges in society, and led to the development of community-based mental hygiene clinics. A psychiatrist, social workers, and a psychologist staffed these clinics, and provided outpatient services and public health and educational initiatives to prevent mental illness. This would later become a key component of the mental health community movement, which influenced the deinstitutionalization era. === 1930s-1940s === Prior to World War II, the majority of research related to social psychiatry focused on the impact of urbanization on serious psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. One of the first social psychiatric studies, 'Mental Disorders in Urban Areas: An Ecological Study of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses', challenged this focus.", "This phenomenon, social psychiatrists argue, is closely tied to poverty and urbanization. == Research == Social psychiatry integrates different social factors of mental health to advocate for systemic changes, such as improving living conditions, addressing discrimination, and ensuring equitable access to mental health care. By combining quantitative and qualitative methods, social psychiatry research aims to identify effective interventions, reduce stigma, and promote mental health equity. === Epidemiology === Social psychiatry relies on epidemiological data to understand the distribution and determinants of mental health. This involves studying the patterns of mental illness within populations, including prevalence and incidence rates. Researchers often analyze risk factors and protective factors associated with mental disorders. === Life events research === Life events research investigates how significant life events, such as loss, trauma, or major life transitions, can impact mental health. It is one example of a longitudinal approach to social psychiatry.", "=== Life events research === Life events research investigates how significant life events, such as loss, trauma, or major life transitions, can impact mental health. It is one example of a longitudinal approach to social psychiatry. By following individuals over time, researchers can identify the long-term consequences of early life experiences and social factors on mental health. === Landmark studies === Several landmark studies have significantly contributed to the field of social psychiatry. ==== Faris and Dunham's Chicago study (1939) ==== This 1939 study, 'Mental Disorders in Urban Areas: An Ecological Study of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses' was one of the first studies to link mental health issues with social and environmental factors, shifting the focus from purely biological explanations to sociological ones. University of Chicago sociologists Robert E. L. Faris and H.", "L. Faris and H. Warren Dunham aimed to examine the relationship between urban environmental factors and rates of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia. Using psychiatric hospital admission records in Chicago, they mapped the distribution of schizophrenia and other psychoses across different neighborhoods, correlating mental illness prevalence with socioeconomic conditions. They found higher rates of schizophrenia in areas with significant poverty, high population turnover, and social disintegration, particularly in inner-city neighborhoods. Mental illness rates decreased as neighborhoods became more stable and affluent. This study laid the foundation for future research on social determinants of mental health and legitimized the role of social science methods in psychiatric research. It also influenced public health policies over the next few decades, including the war on poverty and the community health movements.", "This study laid the foundation for future research on social determinants of mental health and legitimized the role of social science methods in psychiatric research. It also influenced public health policies over the next few decades, including the war on poverty and the community health movements. ==== Hollingshead and Redlich's New Haven study (1958) ==== Social Class and Mental Illness was a collaboration between psychiatrist Frederick Redlich and sociologist August Hollingshead. It explored the relationship between social class and mental illness in New Haven, Connecticut, focusing on disparities in access to and types of mental health care. Using a classification system that divided participants into five social classes, Hollingshead and Redlich analyzed patterns of mental illness diagnoses, treatment settings, and care quality. They found that individuals in lower social classes experienced higher rates of mental illness but were more likely to receive custodial care, while those in upper classes accessed psychotherapy and higher-quality treatments. By highlighting the systemic inequities in mental health care based on social class, this study contributed to social psychiatry by emphasizing the need for equitable mental health services and policy reform to reduce inequities in psychiatric care. ==== Midtown Manhattan study (1962) ==== Mental Health in the Metropolis, published in 1962, was one of the earliest urban studies to systematically document the social factors of mental health.", "By highlighting the systemic inequities in mental health care based on social class, this study contributed to social psychiatry by emphasizing the need for equitable mental health services and policy reform to reduce inequities in psychiatric care. ==== Midtown Manhattan study (1962) ==== Mental Health in the Metropolis, published in 1962, was one of the earliest urban studies to systematically document the social factors of mental health. The study, conducted by two sociologists, one anthropologist, and two psychiatrists, explored the prevalence of mental disorders in urban Midtown Manhattan. This study provided critical evidence of how urban environments impact mental well-being, and emphasized the significance of cultural diversity and social stressors in shaping mental health. It highlighted that social factors like poverty were more influential to mental health compared to simply living in urban environments. ==== Leighton and Murphy's Stirling County study (1948 - present) ==== The Stirling County Study is a longitudinal investigation investigating the social determinants of mental illness in a rural Canadian community. Sociologist and psychiatrist Alexander Leighton and psychiatric epidemiologist Jane Murphy founded the study in 1948, and it is still in effect today. It uses community surveys, interviews, and follow-ups to gather comprehensive data on mental health and social conditions of individuals in the Stirling county community.", "Sociologist and psychiatrist Alexander Leighton and psychiatric epidemiologist Jane Murphy founded the study in 1948, and it is still in effect today. It uses community surveys, interviews, and follow-ups to gather comprehensive data on mental health and social conditions of individuals in the Stirling county community. The long-term nature of this study provided valuable insights for social psychiatry by demonstrating that mental illness did exist in rural communities, not just urban ones. The study revealed that mental illness rates were significantly influenced by social factors, including economic deprivation, social isolation, and family dynamics. Its long-term perspective provided insights into how changing social and economic conditions affect mental health over time. This research also highlighted the unique challenges of mental health in rural settings and helped influence the community mental health center movement. == Current work == Social psychiatry can be most effectively applied in helping to develop mental health promotion and prevent certain mental illnesses by educating individuals, families, and societies. Facilitating the social inclusion of people with mental health problems is a major focus of modern social psychiatry.", "== Current work == Social psychiatry can be most effectively applied in helping to develop mental health promotion and prevent certain mental illnesses by educating individuals, families, and societies. Facilitating the social inclusion of people with mental health problems is a major focus of modern social psychiatry. Social psychiatry research today spans many topics, including the effect of the pandemic, social media, race, and poverty on mental health. It also researches social causes and implications of common mental disorders like depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Modern social psychiatry research continues to address a wide range of topics, including: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health How technology and social media impacts mental health How race, poverty, and socioeconomic status impact mental health Social determinants of substance use disorders Development and evaluation of culturally competent interventions == References == == External links == https://web.archive.org/web/20050327051651/http://www.sanctuaryweb.com/main/social_psychiatry.htm http://library.cpmc.columbia.edu/hsl/archives/findingaids/opler.html Faculty of Rehabilitation and Social Psychiatry of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. Social psychiatry and public mental health: present situation and future objectives. Time for rethinking and renaissance?", "=== 1930s-1940s === Prior to World War II, the majority of research related to social psychiatry focused on the impact of urbanization on serious psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. One of the first social psychiatric studies, 'Mental Disorders in Urban Areas: An Ecological Study of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses', challenged this focus. The study, published in 1939 by University of Chicago sociologists Robert Faris and Warren Dunham, applied a social sciences methodological approach to the study of mental illness. Their findings introduced the concept of social isolation and poverty as factors in mental illness, when existing research had primarily focused on urban versus rural environments. This study captured the attention of United States politicians and policy officials and helped usher in a wave of policy reforms in the coming years. ==== World War II ==== Social psychiatry turned its focus to veteran mental health as a result of World War II. The experiences of soldiers at war and coming home inspired psychiatrists to study the epidemiology of mental illness and the factors that exacerbate it. In particular, psychiatrists in the United Kingdom and United States began to study the impact of the environment on mental illness in soldiers and helped usher in the community mental health movement.", "The experiences of soldiers at war and coming home inspired psychiatrists to study the epidemiology of mental illness and the factors that exacerbate it. In particular, psychiatrists in the United Kingdom and United States began to study the impact of the environment on mental illness in soldiers and helped usher in the community mental health movement. 'Therapeutic communities' started forming across the UK, and community mental health services for outpatient care grew in number across the United States. In 1946, the United States passed the National Mental Health Act, citing the declining mental health of veterans during World War II. This act provided federal funding for prevention and treatment of mental illness. A direct result of this act was the creation of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1949. NMIH was formed to shift care from psychiatric hospitals to community-based services. === 1950s-1960s === As the community mental health movement gained traction, President John F Kennedy passed the Community Mental Health Act in 1963, which provided $2.9 billion to build community mental health centers across the country.", "NMIH was formed to shift care from psychiatric hospitals to community-based services. === 1950s-1960s === As the community mental health movement gained traction, President John F Kennedy passed the Community Mental Health Act in 1963, which provided $2.9 billion to build community mental health centers across the country. This ushered in the deinstitutionalization era, which marked widespread closure of state psychiatric hospitals in favor of community mental health services. Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, declared in his State of the Union in 1964, further advanced social psychiatry in United States public policy. It justified more spending on social welfare programs and community mental health centers. However, its focus on the 'culture of poverty' rather than poverty itself led to criticism among social scientists and psychiatrists. == The decline of social psychiatry == The shifting terrain of American politics impacted the influence of social psychiatry at a national level.", "However, its focus on the 'culture of poverty' rather than poverty itself led to criticism among social scientists and psychiatrists. == The decline of social psychiatry == The shifting terrain of American politics impacted the influence of social psychiatry at a national level. When President Nixon took office in 1969, he dismantled many of the social welfare programs implemented from the war on poverty. In addition, America's involvement in the Vietnam War pulled attention away from domestic affairs and reallocated social welfare spending to war efforts. The 1960s marked several movements that questioned mainstream psychiatry, which social psychiatry had become part of as a result of the policy enacted from its research. Movements like anti-psychiatry, radical psychiatry, and the psychiatric survivors movement protested psychiatric treatments like lobotomies, ECT, and insulin shock therapy. Although social psychiatry was not involved in these therapies, its mainstream status as a field resulted in eroded trust among psychotherapists and psychiatrists. Biological psychiatry as a field was rising in popularity during these counter-culture movements, further eroding social psychiatry as a field.", "Although social psychiatry was not involved in these therapies, its mainstream status as a field resulted in eroded trust among psychotherapists and psychiatrists. Biological psychiatry as a field was rising in popularity during these counter-culture movements, further eroding social psychiatry as a field. Technological advancements in brain imaging techniques influenced this shift in focus and provided genetic and biological explanations for psychiatric disorders, rather than social explanations. These advancements in neurology, psychopharmacology, and genetics fueled the rise of pharmacological drugs like Prozac, for mental disorders and deemphasized the need for psychotherapy. By the 1980s, biological psychiatry had overtaken social psychiatry as the premier mode of research in mental illness. == Core theories and concepts == Social psychiatry emphasizes how social, cultural, and environmental factors influence mental health and illness. It focuses on understanding and addressing the social determinants of mental health, the role of relationships and community in psychological well-being, and the prevention and treatment of mental disorders within broader social contexts. === Psychobiology === Psychobiology, a term first coined by Adolf Meyer in the early 20th century, refers to an interdisciplinary approach to understanding behavior and mental health by integrating biological, psychological, and social factors.", "It focuses on understanding and addressing the social determinants of mental health, the role of relationships and community in psychological well-being, and the prevention and treatment of mental disorders within broader social contexts. === Psychobiology === Psychobiology, a term first coined by Adolf Meyer in the early 20th century, refers to an interdisciplinary approach to understanding behavior and mental health by integrating biological, psychological, and social factors. Meyer, often considered the father of modern American psychiatry, advocated for a holistic perspective that examined the interplay between an individual's biological constitution, psychological experiences, and social environment. This approach was unique because it diverged from models that focused exclusively on either biological or psychodynamic explanations for mental illness. It emphasized the importance of context, life history, and adaptability in understanding human behavior. Psychobiology laid the groundwork for recognizing the role of environmental and relational factors in mental health. By framing psychiatric disorders as dynamic processes influenced by life events and social interactions, psychobiology inspired approaches that consider patients within their broader environment. This influenced later theories, including Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal theory and the study of social determinants of health.", "By framing psychiatric disorders as dynamic processes influenced by life events and social interactions, psychobiology inspired approaches that consider patients within their broader environment. This influenced later theories, including Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal theory and the study of social determinants of health. It also reinforced the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between psychiatry and sociology, anthropology, and public health. === Interpersonal theory === Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal theory emphasizes the role of interpersonal relationships in shaping personality development and mental health, arguing that individuals' personalities are formed and expressed within the context of their social interactions. In his book The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry (1955), Sullivan argued that psychiatric disorders are best understood through interpersonal interactions, not just internal conflicts. By integrating social and cultural influences with biological and intra-psychic models, Sullivan believed it was crucial to examine societal structures and interpersonal systems in order to address mental health challenges. Sullivan proposed that personality develops through relationships and that disruptions in these interactions often underlie psychological distress. He introduced the idea that the \"self\" is shaped by social experiences and outlined a developmental framework linking psychological well-being to navigating interpersonal challenges at different life stages, such as trust in infancy and intimacy in adolescence.", "A biologist is a scientist who conducts research in biology. Biologists are interested in studying life on Earth, whether it is an individual cell, a multicellular organism, or a community of interacting populations. They usually specialize in a particular branch (e.g., molecular biology, zoology, and evolutionary biology) of biology and have a specific research focus (e.g., studying malaria or cancer). Biologists who are involved in basic research have the aim of advancing knowledge about the natural world. They conduct their research using the scientific method, which is an empirical method for testing hypotheses. Their discoveries may have applications for some specific purpose such as in biotechnology, which has the goal of developing medically useful products for humans. In modern times, most biologists have one or more academic degrees such as a bachelor's degree, as well as an advanced degree such as a master's degree or a doctorate. Like other scientists, biologists can be found working in different sectors of the economy such as in academia, nonprofits, private industry, or government.", "In modern times, most biologists have one or more academic degrees such as a bachelor's degree, as well as an advanced degree such as a master's degree or a doctorate. Like other scientists, biologists can be found working in different sectors of the economy such as in academia, nonprofits, private industry, or government. == History == Francesco Redi, the founder of experimental biology, is recognized to be one of the greatest biologists of all time. Robert Hooke, an English natural philosopher, coined the term cell, suggesting plant structure's resemblance to honeycomb cells. Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace independently formulated the theory of evolution by natural selection, which was described in detail in Darwin's book On the Origin of Species, which was published in 1859. In it, Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes of descent with accumulated modification leading to divergence over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology. Separately, Gregor Mendel formulated the principles of inheritance in 1866, which became the basis of modern genetics.", "Much of the work of marine biology centers on molecular biology, the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biology is a branch of oceanography, which is the study of the biological, chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor. (See the Handbook statements on environmental scientists and hydrologists and on geoscientists.) Paleontologists study the history of life on Earth through the analysis of fossils\u2014preserved remains, traces, or impressions of past organisms found within rocks. Their work combines biological knowledge with geological methods, since interpreting fossils requires understanding the stratigraphy, sedimentology, and geochronology of the rock layers in which they occur. Paleontologists reconstruct ancient organisms, ecosystems, and environments; investigate patterns of evolution, extinction, and biodiversity through deep time; and analyze how geological processes influence the preservation and distribution of fossils. Many specialize in particular groups, such as vertebrates, invertebrates, or plants, or in subfields such as taphonomy (the study of fossilization), paleoecology (ancient ecosystems), or biostratigraphy (dating and correlating rock layers using fossils). Evolutionary biologists investigate the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth, starting from a single common ancestor. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation.", "Evolutionary biologists investigate the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth, starting from a single common ancestor. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation. Ecologists investigate the relationships among organisms and between organisms and their environments, examining the effects of population size, pollutants, rainfall, temperature, and altitude. Using knowledge of various scientific disciplines, ecologists may collect, study, and report data on the quality of air, food, soil, and water. == Employment == Biologists typically work regular hours but longer hours are not uncommon. Researchers may be required to work odd hours in laboratories or other locations (especially while in the field), depending on the nature of their research. Many biologists depend on grant money to fund their research. They may be under pressure to meet deadlines and to conform to rigid grant-writing specifications when preparing proposals to seek new or extended funding.", "Many biologists depend on grant money to fund their research.

Some work in laboratories; others work on research ships, and those who work underwater must practice safe diving while working around sharp coral reefs and hazardous marine life. Although some marine biologists obtain their specimens from the sea, many still spend a good deal of their time in laboratories and offices, conducting tests, running experiments, recording results, and compiling data. Biologists are not usually exposed to unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Those who work with dangerous organisms or toxic substances in the laboratory must follow strict safety procedures to avoid contamination. Many biological scientists, such as botanists, ecologists, and zoologists, conduct field studies that involve strenuous physical activity and primitive living conditions.", "Those who work with dangerous organisms or toxic substances in the laboratory must follow strict safety procedures to avoid contamination. Many biological scientists, such as botanists, ecologists, and zoologists, conduct field studies that involve strenuous physical activity and primitive living conditions. Biological scientists in the field may work in warm or cold climates, in all kinds of weather. == Honors and awards == The highest honor awarded to biologists is the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded since 1901, by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Other significant awards include the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences (established in 1980), and the Maxwell/Hanrahan Award in Field Biology (established in 2020). == See also == Biology Glossary of biology List of biologists Lists of biologists by author abbreviation == References == U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook", "The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology. Separately, Gregor Mendel formulated the principles of inheritance in 1866, which became the basis of modern genetics. In 1953, James D. Watson and Francis Crick described the basic structure of DNA, the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms, building on the work of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix. Ian Wilmut led a research group that in 1996 first cloned a mammal from an adult somatic cell, a Finnish Dorset lamb named Dolly. == Education == An undergraduate degree in biology typically requires coursework in molecular and cellular biology, development, ecology, genetics, microbiology, anatomy, physiology, botany, zoology and paleontology. Additional requirements may include physics, chemistry (general, organic, and biochemistry), calculus, and statistics. Students who aspire to a research-oriented career usually pursue a graduate degree such as a master's or a doctorate (e.g., PhD) whereby they would receive training from a research head based on an apprenticeship model that has been in existence since the 1800s.", "Additional requirements may include physics, chemistry (general, organic, and biochemistry), calculus, and statistics.

Students in these graduate programs often receive specialized training in a particular subdiscipline of biology. == Research == Biologists who work in basic research formulate theories and devise experiments to advance human knowledge on life including topics such as evolution, biochemistry, molecular biology, neuroscience and cell biology. Biologists typically conduct laboratory experiments involving animals, plants, microorganisms or biomolecules. However, a small part of biological research also occurs outside the laboratory and may involve natural observation rather than experimentation. For example, a botanist may investigate the plant species present in a particular environment, while an ecologist might study how a forest area recovers after a fire. Biologists who work in applied research use instead the accomplishments gained by basic research to further knowledge in particular fields or applications.", "For example, a botanist may investigate the plant species present in a particular environment, while an ecologist might study how a forest area recovers after a fire. Biologists who work in applied research use instead the accomplishments gained by basic research to further knowledge in particular fields or applications. For example, this applied research may be used to develop new pharmaceutical drugs, treatments and medical diagnostic tests. Biological scientists conducting applied research and product development in private industry may be required to describe their research plans or results to non-scientists who are in a position to veto or approve their ideas. These scientists must consider the business effects of their work. Swift advances in knowledge of genetics and organic molecules spurred growth in the field of biotechnology, transforming the industries in which biological scientists work. Biological scientists can now manipulate the genetic material of animals and plants, attempting to make organisms (including humans) more productive or resistant to disease. Basic and applied research on biotechnological processes, such as recombining DNA, has led to the production of important substances, including human insulin and growth hormone.", "Biological scientists can now manipulate the genetic material of animals and plants, attempting to make organisms (including humans) more productive or resistant to disease. Basic and applied research on biotechnological processes, such as recombining DNA, has led to the production of important substances, including human insulin and growth hormone. Many other substances not previously available in large quantities are now produced by biotechnological means. Some of these substances are useful in treating diseases. Those working on various genome (chromosomes with their associated genes) projects isolate genes and determine their function. This work continues to lead to the discovery of genes associated with specific diseases and inherited health risks, such as sickle cell anemia. Advances in biotechnology have created research opportunities in almost all areas of biology, with commercial applications in areas such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental remediation. === Specializations === Most biological scientists specialize in the study of a certain type of organism or in a specific activity, although recent advances have blurred some traditional classifications.", "Advances in biotechnology have created research opportunities in almost all areas of biology, with commercial applications in areas such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental remediation. === Specializations === Most biological scientists specialize in the study of a certain type of organism or in a specific activity, although recent advances have blurred some traditional classifications. Geneticists study genetics, the science of genes, heredity, and variation of organisms. Neuroscientists study the nervous system. Developmental biologists study the process of development and growth of organisms Biochemists study the chemical composition of living things. They analyze the complex chemical combinations and reactions involved in metabolism, reproduction, and growth. Molecular biologists study the biological activity between biomolecules. Microbiologists investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, or fungi.", "Molecular biologists study the biological activity between biomolecules. Microbiologists investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, or fungi. Physiologists study life functions of plants and animals, in the whole organism and at the cellular or molecular level, under normal and abnormal conditions. Physiologists often specialize in functions such as growth, reproduction, photosynthesis, respiration, or movement, or in the physiology of a certain area or system of the organism. Biophysicists use experimental methods traditionally employed in physics to answer biological questions . Computational biologists apply the techniques of computer science, applied mathematics and statistics to address biological problems.

Zoologists and wildlife biologists study animals and wildlife\u2014their origin, behavior, diseases, and life processes. Some experiment with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings, while others dissect dead animals to study their structure. Zoologists and wildlife biologists also may collect and analyze biological data to determine the environmental effects of current and potential uses of land and water areas. Zoologists usually are identified by the animal group they study. For example, ornithologists study birds, mammalogists study mammals, herpetologists study reptiles and amphibians, ichthyologists study fish, cnidariologists study jellyfishes and entomologists study insects. Botanists study plants and their environments.", "For example, ornithologists study birds, mammalogists study mammals, herpetologists study reptiles and amphibians, ichthyologists study fish, cnidariologists study jellyfishes and entomologists study insects. Botanists study plants and their environments. Some study all aspects of plant life, including algae, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants; others specialize in areas such as identification and classification of plants, the structure and function of plant parts, the biochemistry of plant processes, the causes and cures of plant diseases, the interaction of plants with other organisms and the environment, the geological record of plants and their evolution. Mycologists study fungi, such as yeasts, mold and mushrooms, which are a separate kingdom from plants. Aquatic biologists study micro-organisms, plants, and animals living in water. Marine biologists study salt water organisms, and limnologists study fresh water organisms. Much of the work of marine biology centers on molecular biology, the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biology is a branch of oceanography, which is the study of the biological, chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor.", "The political climate is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable. The phrase has origins from both ancient Greece and medieval-era France. While the concept of a political climate has been used historically to describe both politics and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier \"political\" to the base \"climate\" has been fairly recent. Public opinion is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate. As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, polls are used to estimate what the political climate \"feels\" like on a regular basis. == Etymology == === Climate === According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the base climate comes from the Middle French climat, which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.", "So, polls are used to estimate what the political climate \"feels\" like on a regular basis. == Etymology == === Climate === According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the base climate comes from the Middle French climat, which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314. One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by Joseph Glanvill in 1661 where he mentions \"divers Climates of Opinions\". === Political === The modifier (politic with the \u2013al suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun polis which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government. Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun politicus which is defined as the civil government, to the Middle French adjective politique which is the state of government, or relating to government. == Usage == === Historical example === From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution.", "Morgan. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc., 2005. Print.", "The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic. Socrates\u2014the self-described \"gadfly\" of Athens because of his practice of elenchos (critical interrogation)\u2014was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government. The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E. === Public opinion === The phrase originates from the French term opinion publique, which was first attributed to Montaigne, the father of modern Skepticism and a major figure of the French Renaissance, around 1588 C.E. It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts.", "It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. Public opinion is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are. Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over Proposition 8 in California brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the United States as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent. === Opinion polls === An opinion poll is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a cross-section of the population in question.", "=== Opinion polls === An opinion poll is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a cross-section of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the Wall Street Journal estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as response bias and selection bias. Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the 1948 US presidential election, in which the prediction was that Thomas Dewey would easily defeat Harry Truman. Major polling organizations, including Gallup and Roper, indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.", "The best-known example of this is the 1948 US presidential election, in which the prediction was that Thomas Dewey would easily defeat Harry Truman. Major polling organizations, including Gallup and Roper, indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency. 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK \"Brexit\" referendum and the US presidential election were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect. Polls widely predicted a win for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, while instead Republican candidate Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College and, therefore, the presidency. == See also == Climate Socrates Peloponnesian War Critias Alcibiades Montaigne Proposition 8 Bias == References == == Further reading == Bagby, Laurie.

This force acts over distances that are comparable to the Debye length, which is on the order of one to a few tenths of nanometers. The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the surface charge density (or the electrical surface potential). For two similarly charged objects, this force is repulsive and decays exponentially at larger distances, see figure. For unequally charged objects and eventually at shorted distances, these forces may also be attractive. The theory due to Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (DLVO) combines such double layer forces together with Van der Waals forces in order to estimate the actual interaction potential between colloidal particles.

The second layer corresponds to the diffuse layer, which contains the neutralizing charge consisting of accumulated counterions and depleted coions. The resulting potential profile between these two objects leads to differences in the ionic concentrations within the gap between these objects with respect to the bulk solution. These differences generate an osmotic pressure, which generates a force between these objects. These forces are easily experienced when hands are washed with soap. Adsorbing soap molecules make the skin negatively charged, and the slippery feeling is caused by the strongly repulsive double layer forces.", "On the other hand, when the surface potential is kept constant, one refers to constant potential (CP) boundary condition. In this case, the surface charge density decreases upon approach. Such decrease of charge can be caused by adsorption of desorption of charged ions from the surface. Such variation of adsorbed species upon approach has also been referred to as proximal adsorption. The ability of the surface to regulate its charge can be quantified by the regulation parameter p = C D C I + C D {\\displaystyle p={\\frac {C_{\\rm {D}}}{C_{\\rm {I}}+C_{\\rm {D}}}}} where CD = \u03b50 \u03b5 \u03ba is the diffuse layer capacitance and CI the inner (or regulation) capacitance. The CC conditions are found when p = 1 while the CP conditions for p = 0. The realistic case will be typically situated in between. By solving the DH equation one can show that diffuse layer potential varies upon approach as \u03c8 \u0304 D = 1 1 \u2212 p + p tanh \u2061 ( \u03ba h / 2 ) \u03c8 D {\\displaystyle {\\bar {\\psi }}_{\\rm {D}}={\\frac {1}{1-p+p\\tanh(\\kappa h/2)}}\\psi _{\\rm {D}}} while the surface charged density obey a similar relation \u03c3 \u0304 = tanh \u2061 ( \u03ba h / 2 ) 1 \u2212 p + p tanh \u2061 ( \u03ba h / 2 ) \u03c3 {\\displaystyle {\\bar {\\sigma }}={\\frac {\\tanh(\\kappa h/2)}{1-p+p\\tanh(\\kappa h/2)}}\\sigma } The swelling pressure can be found by inserting the exact solution of the DH equation into the expressions above and one finds \u03a0 = 2 \u03b5 \u03b5 0 \u03ba 2 \u03c8 D 2 e \u2212 \u03ba h [ 1 + ( 1 \u2212 2 p ) e \u2212 \u03ba h ] 2 {\\displaystyle \\Pi =2\\epsilon \\epsilon _{0}\\kappa ^{2}\\psi _{\\rm {D}}^{2}{\\frac {e^{-\\kappa h}}{[1+(1-2p)e^{-\\kappa h}]^{2}}}} Repulsion is strongest for the CC conditions (p = 1) while it is weaker for the CP conditions (p = 0).", "The realistic case will be typically situated in between.

The result of the superposition approximation is always recovered at larger distances but also for p = 1/2 at all distances. The latter fact explains why the superposition approximation can be very accurate even at small separations. Surfaces regulate their charge and not infrequently the actual regulation parameter is not far away from 1/2. The situation is exemplified in the figure below. From stability considerations one can show that p < 1 and that this parameter may also becomes negative. These results can be extended to asymmetric case in a straightforward way.", "From stability considerations one can show that p < 1 and that this parameter may also becomes negative. These results can be extended to asymmetric case in a straightforward way. When surface potentials are replaced by effective potentials, this simple DH picture is applicable for more highly charged surfaces at sufficiently larger distances. At shorter distances, however, one may enter the PB regime and the regulation parameter may not remain constant. In this case, one must solve the PB equation together with an appropriate model of the surface charging process. It was demonstrated experimentally that charge regulation effects can become very important in asymmetric systems. == Extensions to other geometries == Interactions between various objects were studied within the DH and PB models by many researchers. Some of the relevant results are summarized in the following.", "== Extensions to other geometries == Interactions between various objects were studied within the DH and PB models by many researchers. Some of the relevant results are summarized in the following. Non-planar geometries: Objects of other than planar geometries can be treated within the Derjaguin approximation, provided their size is substantially larger than the Debye length. This approximation has been used to estimate the force between two charged colloidal particles as shown in the first figure of this article. The exponential nature of these repulsive forces and the fact that its range is given by the Debye length was confirmed experimentally by direct force measurements, including surface forces apparatus, colloidal probe technique, or optical tweezers. The interaction free energy involving two spherical particles within the DH approximation follows the Yukawa or screened Coulomb potential U = Q 2 4 \u03c0 \u03b5 \u03b5 0 ( e \u03ba a 1 + \u03ba a ) 2 e \u2212 \u03ba r r {\\displaystyle U={\\frac {Q^{2}}{4\\pi \\epsilon \\epsilon _{0}}}\\left({\\frac {e^{\\kappa a}}{1+\\kappa a}}\\right)^{2}{\\frac {e^{-\\kappa r}}{r}}} where r is the center-to-center distance, Q is the particle charge, and a the particle radius. This expression is based on the superposition approximation and is only valid at large separations. This equation can be extended to more highly charged particles by reinterpreting the charge Q as an effective charge.", "This expression is based on the superposition approximation and is only valid at large separations. This equation can be extended to more highly charged particles by reinterpreting the charge Q as an effective charge. To address the interactions in other situation, one must resort to numerical solutions of the DH or PB equation. Non-uniform or patchy charge distribution: Interaction between surfaces with non-uniform and periodic charge distribution has been analyzed within the DH approximation. Such surfaces are referred to have a mosaic or patch-charge distribution. One important conclusion from these studies is that there is an additional attractive electrostatic contribution, which also decays exponentially. When the non-uniformities are arranged in a quadratic lattice with spacing b, the decay length q\u22121 of this additional attraction can be expressed as q 2 = \u03ba 2 + ( 2 \u03c0 b ) 2 {\\displaystyle q^{2}=\\kappa ^{2}+\\left({\\frac {2\\pi }{b}}\\right)^{2}} At high salt levels, this attraction is screened as the interaction between uniformly charged surfaces. At lower salt levels, however, the range of this attraction is related to the characteristic size of the surface charge heterogeneities.", "When the non-uniformities are arranged in a quadratic lattice with spacing b, the decay length q\u22121 of this additional attraction can be expressed as q 2 = \u03ba 2 + ( 2 \u03c0 b ) 2 {\\displaystyle q^{2}=\\kappa ^{2}+\\left({\\frac {2\\pi }{b}}\\right)^{2}} At high salt levels, this attraction is screened as the interaction between uniformly charged surfaces. At lower salt levels, however, the range of this attraction is related to the characteristic size of the surface charge heterogeneities. Three-body forces: The interactions between weakly charged objects are pair-wise additive due to the linear nature of the DH approximation. On the PB level, however, attractive three-body forces are present. The interaction free energy between three objects 1, 2, and 3 can be expressed as F 123 = F 12 + F 12 + F 12 + \u0394 F 123 {\\displaystyle F_{123}=F_{12}+F_{12}+F_{12}+\\Delta F_{123}} where Fij are the pair free energies and \u0394F123 is the non-additive three-body contribution. These three-body contributions were found to be attractive on the PB level, meaning that three charged objects repel less strongly than what one would expect on the basis of pair-wise interactions alone. == Beyond Poisson-Boltzmann approximation == More accurate description of double layer interactions can be put forward on the primitive model. This model treats the electrostatic and hard-core interactions between all individual ions explicitly.", "== Beyond Poisson-Boltzmann approximation == More accurate description of double layer interactions can be put forward on the primitive model. This model treats the electrostatic and hard-core interactions between all individual ions explicitly. However, it includes the solvent only in a \"primitive\" way, namely as a dielectric continuum. This model was studied in much detail in the theoretical community. Explicit expressions for the forces are mostly not available, but they are accessible with computer simulations, integral equations, or density functional theories. The important finding from these studies is that the PB description represents only a mean-field approximation. This approximation is excellent in the so-called weak coupling regime, that is for monovalent electrolytes and weakly charged surfaces. However, this description breaks down in the strong coupling regime, which may be encountered for multivalent electrolytes, highly charged systems, or non-aqueous solvents.", "This approximation is excellent in the so-called weak coupling regime, that is for monovalent electrolytes and weakly charged surfaces. However, this description breaks down in the strong coupling regime, which may be encountered for multivalent electrolytes, highly charged systems, or non-aqueous solvents. In the strong coupling regime, the ions are strongly correlated, meaning that each ion has an exclusion hole around itself. These correlations lead to strong ion adsorption to charged surfaces, which may lead to charge reversal and crystallization of these ions on the surface. These correlations may also induce attractive forces. The range of these forces is typically below 1 nm. == Like-charge attraction controversy == Around 1990, theoretical and experimental evidence has emerged that forces between charged particles suspended in dilute solutions of monovalent electrolytes might be attractive at larger distances. This evidence is in contradiction with the PB theory discussed above, which always predicts repulsive interactions in these situations.", "== Like-charge attraction controversy == Around 1990, theoretical and experimental evidence has emerged that forces between charged particles suspended in dilute solutions of monovalent electrolytes might be attractive at larger distances. This evidence is in contradiction with the PB theory discussed above, which always predicts repulsive interactions in these situations. The theoretical treatment leading to these conclusions was strongly criticized. The experimental findings were mostly based on video-microscopy, but the underlying data analysis was questioned concerning the role of impurities, appropriateness of image processing techniques, and the role of hydrodynamic interactions. Despite the initial criticism, accumulative evidence suggest that the DLVO fails to account for essential physics necessary to describe the experimental observations. While the community remains skeptical regarding the existence of effective attractions between like-charged species, recent computer molecular dynamics simulations with an explicit description of the solvent have demonstrated that the solvent plays an important role in the structure of charged species in solution, while PB and the primitive model do not account for most of these effects. Specifically, the solvent plays a key role in the charge localization of the diffuse ions in ion-rich domains that bring charged species closer together. Based on this idea, simulations have explained experimental trends such as the disappearance of a scattering peak in salt-free polyelectrolyte solutions and the structural inhomogeneities of charged colloidal particles/nanoparticles observed experimentally that PB and primitive model approaches fail to explain.", "Specifically, the solvent plays a key role in the charge localization of the diffuse ions in ion-rich domains that bring charged species closer together.

These forces are responsible for swelling of clays. They may also be responsible for the stabilization of colloidal suspension and will prevent particle aggregation of highly charged colloidal particles in aqueous suspensions. At low salt concentrations, the repulsive double layer forces can become rather long-ranged, and may lead to structuring of colloidal suspensions and eventually to formation of colloidal crystals. Such repulsive forces may further induce blocking of surfaces during particle deposition. Double layer interactions are equally relevant for surfactant aggregates, and may be responsible to the stabilization of cubic phases made of spheroidal micelles or lamellar phases consisting of surfactant or lipid bilayers.", "These forces are easily experienced when hands are washed with soap. Adsorbing soap molecules make the skin negatively charged, and the slippery feeling is caused by the strongly repulsive double layer forces. These forces are further relevant in many colloidal or biological systems, and may be responsible for their stability, formation of colloidal crystals, or their rheological properties. == Poisson\u2013Boltzmann model == The most popular model to describe the electrical double layer is the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model. This model can be equally used to evaluate double layer forces. Let us discuss this model in the case of planar geometry as shown in the figure on the right. In this case, the electrical potential profile \u03c8(z) near a charged interface will only depend on the position z. The corresponding Poisson's equation reads in SI units d 2 \u03c8 d z 2 = \u2212 \u03c1 \u03b5 0 \u03b5 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}\\psi }{dz^{2}}}=-{\\frac {\\rho }{\\epsilon _{0}\\epsilon }}} where \u03c1 is the charge density per unit volume, \u03b50 the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum, and \u03b5 the dielectric constant of the liquid.", "Such repulsive forces may further induce blocking of surfaces during particle deposition. Double layer interactions are equally relevant for surfactant aggregates, and may be responsible to the stabilization of cubic phases made of spheroidal micelles or lamellar phases consisting of surfactant or lipid bilayers. == See also == == References ==", "In this case, the electrical potential profile \u03c8(z) near a charged interface will only depend on the position z.

For a symmetric electrolyte consisting of cations and anions having a charge \u00b1q, the charge density can be expressed as \u03c1 = q ( c + \u2212 c \u2212 ) {\\displaystyle \\rho =q(c_{+}-c_{-})} where c\u00b1 = N\u00b1/V are the concentrations of the cations and anions, where N\u00b1 are their numbers and V the sample volume. These profiles can be related to the electrical potential by considering the fact that the chemical potential of the ions is constant. For both ions, this relation can be written as \u03bc \u00b1 = \u03bc + ( 0 ) + k T ln \u2061 c \u00b1 \u00b1 q \u03c8 {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\pm }=\\mu _{+}^{(0)}+kT\\ln c_{\\pm }\\pm q\\psi } where \u03bc \u00b1 ( 0 ) {\\displaystyle \\mu _{\\pm }^{(0)}} is the reference chemical potential, T the absolute temperature, and k the Boltzmann constant. The reference chemical potential can be eliminated by applying the same equation far away from the surface where the potential is assumed to vanish and concentrations attain the bulk concentration cB. The concentration profiles thus become c \u00b1 = c B e \u2213 \u03b2 q \u03c8 {\\displaystyle c_{\\pm }=c_{\\rm {B}}e^{\\mp \\beta q\\psi }} where \u03b2 = 1/(kT).

This relation reflects the Boltzmann distribution of the ions with the energy \u00b1q\u03c8. Inserting these relations into the Poisson equation one obtains the PB equation d 2 \u03c8 d z 2 = q c B \u03b5 0 \u03b5 [ e + \u03b2 q \u03c8 \u2212 e \u2212 \u03b2 q \u03c8 ] {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}\\psi }{dz^{2}}}={\\frac {qc_{\\rm {B}}}{\\epsilon _{0}\\epsilon }}[e^{+\\beta q\\psi }-e^{-\\beta q\\psi }]} The potential profile between two plates is normally obtained by solving this equation numerically. Once the potential profile is known, the force per unit area between the plates expressed as the disjoining pressure \u03a0 can be obtained as follows. The starting point is the Gibbs\u2013Duhem relation for a two component system at constant temperature \u2212 V d \u03a0 + N + d \u03bc + + N \u2212 d \u03bc \u2212 = 0 {\\displaystyle -Vd\\Pi +N_{+}d\\mu _{+}+N_{-}d\\mu _{-}=0} Introducing the concentrations c\u00b1 and using the expressions of the chemical potentials \u03bc\u00b1 given above one finds d \u03a0 = k T ( d c + + d c \u2212 ) + q ( c + \u2212 c \u2212 ) d \u03c8 {\\displaystyle d\\Pi =kT(dc_{+}+dc_{-})+q(c_{+}-c_{-})d\\psi } The concentration difference can be eliminated with the Poisson equation and the resulting equation can be integrated from infinite separation of the plates to the actual separation h by realizing that 2 ( d 2 \u03c8 / d z 2 ) d \u03c8 = d ( d \u03c8 / d z ) 2 {\\displaystyle 2(d^{2}\\psi /dz^{2})d\\psi =d(d\\psi /dz)^{2}} Expressing the concentration profiles in terms of the potential profiles one obtains \u03a0 = k T c B ( e + \u03b2 q \u03c8 + e \u2212 \u03b2 q \u03c8 \u2212 2 ) \u2212 \u03b5 0 \u03b5 2 ( d \u03c8 d z ) 2 {\\displaystyle \\Pi =kTc_{\\rm {B}}(e^{+\\beta q\\psi }+e^{-\\beta q\\psi }-2)-{\\frac {\\epsilon _{0}\\epsilon }{2}}\\left({\\frac {d\\psi }{dz}}\\right)^{2}} From a known electrical potential profile \u03c8(z) one can calculate the disjoining pressure from this equation at any suitable position z. Alternative derivation of the same relation for disjoining pressure involves the stress tensor. == Debye-H\u00fcckel model == When the electric potentials or charge densities are not too high, the PB equation can be simplified to the Debye-H\u00fcckel (DH) equation.

In non-aqueous solutions, Debye length can be substantially larger than the ones given in the table due to smaller dielectric constants. The DH model represents a good approximation, when the surface potentials are sufficiently low with respect to the limiting values \u03b2 q \u03c8 \u226a 1 o r \u03c8 \u226a k T q \u2243 26 m V {\\displaystyle \\beta q\\psi \\ll 1\\;\\;\\;{\\rm {or}}\\;\\;\\;\\psi \\ll {\\frac {kT}{q}}\\simeq 26\\;{\\rm {mV}}} The numerical value refers to a monovalent salt and 25\u00b0C. In practice, the DH approximation remains rather accurate up to surface potentials that are comparable to the limiting values given above. The disjoining pressure can be obtained from the PB equation given above, which can also be simplified to the DH case by expanding into Taylor series. The resulting expression is \u03a0 = \u03b5 0 \u03b5 2 [ \u03ba 2 \u03c8 2 \u2212 ( d \u03c8 d z ) 2 ] {\\displaystyle \\Pi ={\\frac {\\epsilon _{0}\\epsilon }{2}}\\left[\\kappa ^{2}\\psi ^{2}-\\left({\\frac {d\\psi }{dz}}\\right)^{2}\\right]} The substantial advantage of the DH model over the PB model is that the forces can be obtained analytically.

Some of the relevant cases will be discussed below. == Superposition approximation == When the surfaces are sufficiently far apart, the potential profiles originating from each individual surface will not be much perturbed by the presence of the other surface. This approximation thus suggests that one can simply add (superpose) the potentials profiles originating from each surface as illustrated the figure. Since the potential profile passes through a minimum at the mid-plane, it is easiest to evaluate the disjoining pressure at the midplane. The solution of the DH equation for an isolated wall reads \u03c8 ( z ) = \u03c8 D e \u2212 \u03ba z {\\displaystyle \\psi (z)=\\psi _{\\rm {D}}e^{-\\kappa z}} where z is the distance from the surface and \u03c8D the surface potential.

Due to the screening by the electrolyte, the range of the force is given by the Debye length and its strength by the surface potential (or surface charge density). This approximation turns out to be exact provided the plate-plate separation is large compared to the Debye length and the surface potentials are low. This result can be simply generalized to highly charged surfaces, but only at larger separations. Even if the potential is large close to the surface, it will be small at larger distances, and can be described by the DH equation. However, in this case one has to replace the actual diffuse layer potential \u03c8D with the effective potential \u03c8eff. Within the PB model, this effective potential can be evaluated analytically, and reads \u03c8 e f f = 4 \u03b2 q tanh \u2061 ( \u03b2 q \u03c8 D ) {\\displaystyle \\psi _{\\rm {eff}}={\\frac {4}{\\beta q}}\\tanh(\\beta q\\psi _{\\rm {D}})} The superposition approximation can be easily extended to asymmetric systems.", "However, in this case one has to replace the actual diffuse layer potential \u03c8D with the effective potential \u03c8eff.

At larger distances, oppositely charged surfaces repel and equally charged ones attract. == Charge regulating surfaces == While the superposition approximation is actually exact at larger distances, it is no longer accurate at smaller separations. Solutions of the DH or PB equations in between the plates provide a more accurate picture at these conditions. Let us only discuss the symmetric situation within the DH model here.

In this case, the surface charge density decreases upon approach.", "Singularity studies is an interdisciplinary academic field which examines the idea of technological singularity \u2014 the hypothesised point at which artificial intelligence may surpass human intelligence, might be attained by artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and other technologies and sciences, and its social impacts.

Intelligence Explosion FAQ by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute The Coming Technological Singularity:How to Survive in the Post-Human Era (on Vernor Vinge's web site, retrieved Jul 2019)", "Microfluidic cell culture integrates knowledge from biology, biochemistry, engineering, and physics to develop devices and techniques for culturing, maintaining, analyzing, and experimenting with cells at the microscale. It merges microfluidics, a set of technologies used for the manipulation of small fluid volumes (\u03bcL, nL, pL) within artificially fabricated microsystems, and cell culture, which involves the maintenance and growth of cells in a controlled laboratory environment. Microfluidics has been used for cell biology studies as the dimensions of the microfluidic channels are well suited for the physical scale of cells (in the order of magnitude of 10 micrometers). For example, eukaryotic cells have linear dimensions between 10 and 100 \u03bcm which falls within the range of microfluidic dimensions. A key component of microfluidic cell culture is being able to mimic the cell microenvironment which includes soluble factors that regulate cell structure, function, behavior, and growth. Another important component for the devices is the ability to produce stable gradients that are present in vivo as these gradients play a significant role in understanding chemotactic, durotactic, and haptotactic effects on cells. == Fabrication == Some considerations for microfluidic devices relating to cell culture include: fabrication material (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polystyrene) culture region geometry control system for delivering and removing media when needed using either passive methods (e.g., gravity-driven flow, capillary pumps, or Laplace pressure based 'passive pumping') or a flow-rate controlled device (i.e., perfusion system) Fabrication material is crucial as not all polymers are biocompatible, with some materials such as PDMS causing undesirable adsorption or absorption of small molecules. Additionally, uncured PDMS oligomers can leach into the cell culture media, which can harm the microenvironment.", "== Fabrication == Some considerations for microfluidic devices relating to cell culture include: fabrication material (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polystyrene) culture region geometry control system for delivering and removing media when needed using either passive methods (e.g., gravity-driven flow, capillary pumps, or Laplace pressure based 'passive pumping') or a flow-rate controlled device (i.e., perfusion system) Fabrication material is crucial as not all polymers are biocompatible, with some materials such as PDMS causing undesirable adsorption or absorption of small molecules. Additionally, uncured PDMS oligomers can leach into the cell culture media, which can harm the microenvironment. As an alternative to commonly used PDMS, there have been advances in the use of thermoplastics (e.g., polystyrene) as a replacement material. Spatial organization of cells in microscale devices largely depends on the culture region geometry for cells to perform functions in vivo. For example, long, narrow channels may be desired to culture neurons. The perfusion system chosen might also affect the geometry chosen. For example, in a system that incorporates syringe pumps, channels for perfusion inlet, perfusion outlet, waste, and cell loading would need to be added for the cell culture maintenance. Perfusion in microfluidic cell culture is important to enable long culture periods on-chip and cell differentiation.", "developed a 25x75 mm, easily accessible microfluidic device. This design is used to optimize the conditions by changing well diameters, UV light exposure (causing mutagenesis), and light/no light tests for culturing Botryococcus braunii, which is one of the most common freshwater microalgae for biofuel production. ==== Bacteria and yeast ==== Microfluidic systems can be used to incubate high volumes of bacteria and yeast colonies. The two-layer microchemostat device is made to allow scientists to culture cells under chemostatic and thermostatic conditions without moving cells around and causing intercellular interaction. Yeast cell suspension droplets can be placed on a plate with patterned hydrophilic areas and incubated for 24 hours; then the droplets are split the produced proteins from yeast are analyzed by MALDI-MS without killing the cells in the original droplets. == Multi-culture in microfluidics == Compared to the highly complex microenvironment in vivo, traditional mono-culture of single cell types in vitro only provides limited information about cellular behavior due to the lack of interactions with other cell types. Typically, cell-to-cell signaling can be divided into four categories depending on the distance: endocrine signaling, paracrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and juxtacrine signaling. For example, in paracrine signaling, growth factors secreted from one cell diffuse over a short distance to the neighboring target cell, whereas in juxtacrine signaling, membrane-bound ligands of one cell directly bind to surface receptors of adjacent cells.", "Typically, cell-to-cell signaling can be divided into four categories depending on the distance: endocrine signaling, paracrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and juxtacrine signaling. For example, in paracrine signaling, growth factors secreted from one cell diffuse over a short distance to the neighboring target cell, whereas in juxtacrine signaling, membrane-bound ligands of one cell directly bind to surface receptors of adjacent cells. There are three conventional approaches to incorporate cell signaling in in vitro cell culture: conditioned media transfer, mixed (or direct) co-culture, and segregated (or indirect) co-culture. The use of conditioned media, where the cultured medium of one cell type (the effector) is introduced to the culture of another cell type (the responder), is a traditional way to include the effects of soluble factors in cell signaling. However, this method only allows one-way signaling, does not apply to short-lived factors (which often degrade before transfer to the responder cell culture), and does not allow temporal observations of the secreted factors. Recently, co-culture has become the predominant approach to study the effect of cellular communication by culturing two biologically related cell types together. Mixed co-culture is the simplest co-culture method, where two types of cells are in direct contact within a single culture compartment at the desired cell ratio. Cells can communicate by paracrine and juxtacrine signaling, but separated treatments and downstream analysis of a single cell type are not readily feasible due to the completely mixed population of cells.", "Mixed co-culture is the simplest co-culture method, where two types of cells are in direct contact within a single culture compartment at the desired cell ratio. Cells can communicate by paracrine and juxtacrine signaling, but separated treatments and downstream analysis of a single cell type are not readily feasible due to the completely mixed population of cells. The more common method is segregated co-culture, where the two cell types are physically separated but can communicate in shared media by paracrine signaling. The physical barrier can be a porous membrane, a solid wall, or a hydrogel divider. If the physical barrier is removable (such as in PDMS or hydrogel), the assay can also be used to study cell invasion or cell migration. Co-culture designs can be adapted to tri- or multi-culture, which are often more representative of in vivo conditions relative to co-culture. === Closed channel multi-culture systems === The flexibility of microfluidic devices greatly contributes to the development of multi-culture studies by improved control over spatial patterns. Closed channel systems made by PDMS are most commonly used because PDMS has traditionally enabled rapid prototyping.", "=== Closed channel multi-culture systems === The flexibility of microfluidic devices greatly contributes to the development of multi-culture studies by improved control over spatial patterns. Closed channel systems made by PDMS are most commonly used because PDMS has traditionally enabled rapid prototyping. For example, mixed co-culture can be achieved in droplet-based microfluidics easily by a co-encapsulation system to study paracrine and juxtacrine signaling. Two types of cells are co-encapsulated in droplets by combining two streams of cell-laden agarose solutions. After gelation, the agarose microgels will serve as a 3D microenvironment for cell co-culture. Segregated co-culture is also realized in microfluidic channels to study paracrine signaling. Human alveolar epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells can be co-cultured in compartmentalized PDMS channels, separated by a thin, porous, and stretchable PDMS membrane to mimic alveolar-capillary barrier. Endothelial cells can also be co-cultured with cancer cells in a monolayer while separated by a 3D collagen scaffold to study endothelial cell migration and capillary growth.", "Human alveolar epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells can be co-cultured in compartmentalized PDMS channels, separated by a thin, porous, and stretchable PDMS membrane to mimic alveolar-capillary barrier. Endothelial cells can also be co-cultured with cancer cells in a monolayer while separated by a 3D collagen scaffold to study endothelial cell migration and capillary growth. When embedded in gels, salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) cells can be co-cultured with carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in a 3D extracellular matrix to study stroma-regulated cancer invasion in the 3D environment. If juxtacrine signaling is to be investigated solely without paracrine signaling, a single cell coupling co-culture microfluidic array can be designed based on a cellular valving principle. === Open channel multi-culture systems === Although closed channel microfluidics (discussed in the section above) offers high customizability and biological complexity for multi-culture, the operation often requires handling expertise and specialized equipment, such as pumps and valves. In addition, the use of PDMS is known to cause adverse effects to cell culture, including leaching of oligomers or absorption of small molecules, thus often doubted by biologists. Therefore, open microfluidic devices made of polystyrene (PS), a well-established cell culture material, started to emerge. The advantages of open multi-culture designs are direct pipette accessibility and easy fabrication (micro-milling, 3D printing, injection molding, or razor-printing \u2013 without the need for a subsequent bonding step or channel clearance techniques).", "Therefore, open microfluidic devices made of polystyrene (PS), a well-established cell culture material, started to emerge. The advantages of open multi-culture designs are direct pipette accessibility and easy fabrication (micro-milling, 3D printing, injection molding, or razor-printing \u2013 without the need for a subsequent bonding step or channel clearance techniques). They can also be incorporated into traditional cultureware (well plate or petri dish) while remaining the complexity for multi-culture experiments. For example, the \"monorail device\" which patterns hydrogel walls along a rail via spontaneous capillary flow can be inserted into commercially available 24-well plates. Flexible patterning geometries are achieved by merely changing 3D printed or milled inserts. The monorail device can also be adapted to study multikingdom soluble factor signaling, which is difficult in traditional shared media co-culture due to the different media and culture requirements for microbial and mammalian cells. Another open multi-culture device fabricated by razor-printing is capable of integrating numerous culture modalities, including 2D, 3D, Transwell, and spheroid culture. It also shows improved diffusion to promote soluble factor paracrine signaling.", "Another open multi-culture device fabricated by razor-printing is capable of integrating numerous culture modalities, including 2D, 3D, Transwell, and spheroid culture. It also shows improved diffusion to promote soluble factor paracrine signaling. == Controlling cell microenvironment == Microfluidic systems expand their ability to control the local cell microenvironment beyond what is possible with conventional culture systems. Being able to provide different environments in a steady, sustainable and precise manner has a significant impact on cell culture research and study. Those environmental factors include physical (shear stress), biochemical (cell-cell interactions, cell-molecule interactions, cell-substrate interactions), and physicochemical (pH, CO2, temperature, O2) factors. === Oxygen concentration control === Oxygen plays an essential role in biological systems. Oxygen concentration control is one of the key elements when designing the microfluidic systems, whether the aerobic species or when modulating cellular functions in vivo, such as baseline metabolism and function. Multiple microfluidic systems have been designed to control the desired gas concentrations for cell culture.", "Oxygen concentration control is one of the key elements when designing the microfluidic systems, whether the aerobic species or when modulating cellular functions in vivo, such as baseline metabolism and function. Multiple microfluidic systems have been designed to control the desired gas concentrations for cell culture. For example, generating oxygen gradients was achieved by single-thin-layer PDMS construction within channels (thicknesses less than 50 \u03bcm, diffusion coefficient of oxygen in native PDMS at 25 \u00b0C, D= 3.55x10\u22125 cm2 s\u22121) without using gas cylinders or oxygen scavenging agents; thus the microfluidic cell culture device can be placed in incubators and be operated easily. However, the PDMS may be problematic for the adsorption of small hydrophobic species. Poly(methyl pentene) (PMP) may be an alternative material, because it has high oxygen permeability and biocompatibility like PDMS. In addition to the challenges of controlling gas concentration, monitoring oxygen in the microfluidic system is another challenge to address. There are numerous different dye indicators that can be used as optical, luminescence-based oxygen sensing, which is based on the phenomenon of luminescence quenching by oxygen, without consuming oxygen in the system. This technique makes monitoring oxygen in microscale environments feasible and can be applied in biological laboratories.", "There are numerous different dye indicators that can be used as optical, luminescence-based oxygen sensing, which is based on the phenomenon of luminescence quenching by oxygen, without consuming oxygen in the system. This technique makes monitoring oxygen in microscale environments feasible and can be applied in biological laboratories. === Temperature control === Temperature can be sensed by cells and influences their behavior, such as biochemical reaction kinetics. However, it is hard to control high-resolution temperature in traditional cell culture systems; whereas, microfluidic systems are proven to successfully reach the desired temperature under different temperature conditions through several techniques. For example, the temperature gradient in the microfluidic system can be achieved by mixing two or more inputs at different temperatures and flow rates, and the temperature is measured in the outlet channels by embedding polymer-based aquarium thermocouples. Also, by installing heaters and digital temperature sensors at the base of the microfluidic system, it has been demonstrated that a microfluidic cell culture system can continuously operate for at least 500 hours. The circulating water channels in the microfluidic system are also used to precisely control temperatures of the cell culture channels and chambers. Furthermore, putting the device inside a cell culture incubator can also easily control the cell culture temperature.", "The circulating water channels in the microfluidic system are also used to precisely control temperatures of the cell culture channels and chambers. Furthermore, putting the device inside a cell culture incubator can also easily control the cell culture temperature. == See also == Microphysiometry == References ==", "For example, in a system that incorporates syringe pumps, channels for perfusion inlet, perfusion outlet, waste, and cell loading would need to be added for the cell culture maintenance. Perfusion in microfluidic cell culture is important to enable long culture periods on-chip and cell differentiation. Other critical aspects for controlling the microenvironment include: cell seeding density, reduction of air bubbles as they can rupture cell membranes, evaporation of media due to an insufficiently humid environment, and cell culture maintenance (i.e. regular, timely media changes). Cell's health is defined as the collective equilibrium activities of essential and specialized cellular processes; while a cell stressor is defined as a stimulus that causes excursion from its equilibrium state. Hence, cell health may be perturbed within microsystems based on platform design or operating conditions. Exposure to stressors within microsystems can impact cells through direct and indirect ways. Therefore, it is important to design the microfluidics system for cell culture in a manner that minimizes cell stress situations.", "Exposure to stressors within microsystems can impact cells through direct and indirect ways. Therefore, it is important to design the microfluidics system for cell culture in a manner that minimizes cell stress situations. For example, by minimizing cell suspension, by avoiding abrupt geometries (which tend to favor bubble formation), designing higher and wider channels (to avoid shear stress), or avoiding thermosensitive hydrogels. == Advantages == Some of the major advantages of microfluidic cell culture include reduced sample volumes (especially important when using primary cells, which are often limited) and the flexibility to customize and study multiple microenvironments within the same device. A reduced cell population can also be used in a microscale system (e.g., a few hundred cells) in comparison to macroscale culture systems (which often require 105 \u2013 107 cells); this can make studying certain cell-cell interactions more accessible. These reduced cell numbers make studying non-dividing or slow dividing cells (e.g., stem cells) easier than traditional culture methods (e.g., flasks, petri dishes, or well plates) due to the smaller sample volumes. Given the small dimensions in microfluidics, laminar flow can be achieved, allowing manipulations with the culture system to be done easily without affecting other culture chambers. Laminar flow is also useful as is it mimics in vivo fluid dynamics more accurately, often making microscale culture more relevant than traditional culture methods.", "Given the small dimensions in microfluidics, laminar flow can be achieved, allowing manipulations with the culture system to be done easily without affecting other culture chambers. Laminar flow is also useful as is it mimics in vivo fluid dynamics more accurately, often making microscale culture more relevant than traditional culture methods. Compartmentalized microfluidic cultures have also been combined with live cell calcium imaging, where depolarizing stimuli have been delivered to the peripheral terminals of neurons, and calcium responses recorded in the cell body. This technique has demonstrated a stark difference in the sensitivity of the peripheral terminals compared to the neuronal cell body to certain stimuli such as protons. This gives an excellent example as to why it is so important to study the peripheral terminals in isolation using microfluidic cell culture devices. == Culture platforms == === Traditional cell culture === Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture is cell culture that takes place on a flat surface, e.g. the bottom of a well-plate, and is known as the conventional method. While these platforms are useful for growing and passaging cells to be used in subsequent experiments, they are not ideal environments to monitor cell responses to stimuli as cells cannot freely move or perform functions as observed in vivo that are dependent on cell-extracellular matrix material interactions.", "the bottom of a well-plate, and is known as the conventional method. While these platforms are useful for growing and passaging cells to be used in subsequent experiments, they are not ideal environments to monitor cell responses to stimuli as cells cannot freely move or perform functions as observed in vivo that are dependent on cell-extracellular matrix material interactions. To address this issue many methods have been developed to create a three-dimensional (3D) native cell environment. One example of a 3D method is the hanging drop, where a droplet with growing cells is suspended and hangs downwards, which allows cells to grow around and atop of one another, forming a spheroid. The hanging drop method has been used to culture tumor cells but is limited to the geometry of a sphere. Since the advent of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device fabrication through soft lithography microfluidic devices have progressed and have proven to be very beneficial for mimicking a natural 3D environment for cell culture. === Microfluidic cell culture === Microfluidic devices make possible the study of a single cell to a few hundred cells in a 3D environment. Comparatively, macroscopic 2D cultures have 104 to 107 cells on a flat surface.", "=== Microfluidic cell culture === Microfluidic devices make possible the study of a single cell to a few hundred cells in a 3D environment. Comparatively, macroscopic 2D cultures have 104 to 107 cells on a flat surface. Microfluidics also allow for chemical gradients, the continuous flow of fresh media, high through put testing, and direct output to analytical instruments. Additionally, open microfluidic cell cultures such as \"microcanals\" allow for direct physical manipulation of cells with micropipettes. Many microfluidic systems employ the use of hydrogels as the extracellular matrix (ECM) support which can be modulated for fiber thickness and pore size and have been demonstrated to allow the growth of cancer cells. Gel free 3D cell cultures have been developed to allow cells to grow in either a cell dense environment or an ECM poor environment. Although these devices have proven very useful, there are certain disadvantages such as cells sticking to the PDMS surface, small molecules diffusing into the PDMS, and unreacted PDMS polymers washing into cell culture media. The use of 3D cell cultures in microfluidic devices has led to a field of study called organ-on-a-chip.", "Although these devices have proven very useful, there are certain disadvantages such as cells sticking to the PDMS surface, small molecules diffusing into the PDMS, and unreacted PDMS polymers washing into cell culture media. The use of 3D cell cultures in microfluidic devices has led to a field of study called organ-on-a-chip. The first report of these types of microfluidic cultures was used to study the toxicity of naphthalene metabolites on the liver and lung (Viravaidya et al.). These devices can grow a stripped-down version of an organ-like system that can be used to understand many biological processes. By adding an additional dimension, more advanced cell architectures can be achieved, and cell behavior is more representative of in vivo dynamics; cells can engage in enhanced communication with neighboring cells and cell-extracellular matrix interactions can be modeled. In these devices, chambers or collagen layers containing different cell types can interact with one another for multiple days while various channels deliver nutrients to the cells. An advantage of these devices is that tissue function can be characterized and observed under controlled conditions (e.g., effect of shear stress on cells, effect of cyclic strain or other forces) to better understand the overall function of the organ. While these 3D models offer better model organ function on a cellular level compared with 2D models, there are still challenges.", "An advantage of these devices is that tissue function can be characterized and observed under controlled conditions (e.g., effect of shear stress on cells, effect of cyclic strain or other forces) to better understand the overall function of the organ. While these 3D models offer better model organ function on a cellular level compared with 2D models, there are still challenges. Some of the challenges include: imaging of the cells, control of gradients in static models (i.e., without a perfusion system), and difficulty recreating vasculature. Despite these challenges, 3D models are still used as tools for studying and testing drug responses in pharmacological studies. In recent years, there are microfluidic devices reproducing the complex in vivo microvascular network. Organs-on-a-chip have also been used to replicate very complex systems like lung epithelial cells in an exposed airway and provides valuable insight for how multicellular systems and tissues function in vivo. These devices are able to create a physiologically realistic 3D environment, which is desirable as a tool for drug screening, drug delivery, cell-cell interactions, tumor metastasis etc. In one study, researchers grew tumor cells and tested the drug delivery of cis platin, resveratrol, tirapazamine (TPZ) and then measured the effects the drugs have on cell viability.", "These devices are able to create a physiologically realistic 3D environment, which is desirable as a tool for drug screening, drug delivery, cell-cell interactions, tumor metastasis etc. In one study, researchers grew tumor cells and tested the drug delivery of cis platin, resveratrol, tirapazamine (TPZ) and then measured the effects the drugs have on cell viability. == Applications of cells in microfluidic systems == Microfluidic systems can be used to culture several cell types. === Culture of mammalian cells === Mammalian cell cultures can be seeded, grown for several weeks, detached, and passaged to a fresh culture medium ad nauseam by digital microfluidic (DMF) devices on a macro-scale. === Culture of non-mammalian cells === ==== Algae ==== Algae can be incubated, and their growth rate and lipid production can be monitored in a hanging-drop microfluidic system. For example, Mishra et al. developed a 25x75 mm, easily accessible microfluidic device. This design is used to optimize the conditions by changing well diameters, UV light exposure (causing mutagenesis), and light/no light tests for culturing Botryococcus braunii, which is one of the most common freshwater microalgae for biofuel production.", "Sociology of philosophy or philosophical sociology is an academic discipline of both sociology and philosophy that seeks to understand the influence of philosophical thought upon society alongside societal influence upon philosophy. It seeks to understand the social conditions in which the intellectual activity and effects of philosophy take place within to frame our understanding of explorations of truth and knowledge as social processes. == History == The genealogy or founding of sociology can be traced from philosophy in its questions of society and societal knowledge. Prominent sociologists, including Marx and Durkheim, came from a philosophical background. The precise separation of sociology and philosophy is blurred and changing. Sociology grew into a discipline out of philosophical research into a focus of the social and the workings of society. Philosophy itself, having withdrawn from claims of the natural world cemented by the rise of empiricism in the Enlightenment Era, instead focused further on criticism of both its way of \"knowing\" knowledge as well as other disciplines' claims on knowledge or epistemology. Because of this, the history of sociology and philosophy is a pattern of toing and froing, of each examining the other alongside interdisciplinary explorations that intersect them both.", "Philosophy itself, having withdrawn from claims of the natural world cemented by the rise of empiricism in the Enlightenment Era, instead focused further on criticism of both its way of \"knowing\" knowledge as well as other disciplines' claims on knowledge or epistemology.

While folding designs have been used previously in clamshell or \"flip phone\" models, the term \"foldable\" now generally refers to a newer style featuring flexible displays. Some variants of the concept instead use multiple touchscreen panels connected by a hinge. Concepts for such devices date back as early as Nokia's \"Morph\" concept in 2008 and a concept presented by Samsung Electronics in 2013, which was part of a broader set of ideas using flexible OLED displays. The first commercially available folding smartphones with OLED displays began to appear in 2018. Some devices fold on a vertical axis into a wider, tablet-like form while remaining usable in a smaller, folded state. The display may either wrap around to the back of the device when folded, as seen with the Royole FlexPai and Huawei Mate X, or use a booklet-style design, where the larger, folded screen is located inside and a smaller screen on the cover allows interaction without opening the device, as with the Samsung Galaxy Fold series.

Horizontally folding smartphones have also been produced, typically using a clamshell form factor.

Plastic displays are naturally capable of sustaining the required bend radius for a foldable smartphone, but they are more susceptible to blemishes and scratches than traditional glass smartphone displays. Although Corning does produce a flexible glass product known as Willow Glass, the company states that its manufacturing process requires use of a salt solution\u2014thus making it unsuitable for electronic displays because the salt can damage the transistors used in OLED panels (which are built directly on the panel). Nonetheless, the company stated in March 2019 that it was in the process of developing a flexible glass suitable for smartphones, which would be 1 mm (0.039 in) thick and have a 5 mm (0.20 in) bend radius.

The camera rotated with the screen so that the same sensor could face both forward and rear In 2017, ZTE released the Axon M with a similar hinge to the Medias W. ZTE stated that the more powerful hardware of modern smartphones, and improvements to multitasking and tablet support on Android, helped to improve this experience.", "The camera rotated with the screen so that the same sensor could face both forward and rear In 2017, ZTE released the Axon M with a similar hinge to the Medias W. ZTE stated that the more powerful hardware of modern smartphones, and improvements to multitasking and tablet support on Android, helped to improve this experience. The development of thin, flexible OLED displays enabled the possibility for new designs and form factors. During its Consumer Electronics Show keynote in 2013, Samsung presented several concepts\u2014codenamed Youm - for smartphones incorporating flexible displays. One such concept was a smartphone that could fold outward into a single, uninterrupted tablet-sized display. The first Youm concept to make it to a production model was the Galaxy Note Edge\u2014a phablet with a portion of the screen that sloped over the right-hand bezel. Speculation surrounding the development of folding phones using OLED displays began to emerge more rapidly in 2018. In January 2018, it was reported that LG Electronics had obtained a design patent for a folding smartphone.", "Speculation surrounding the development of folding phones using OLED displays began to emerge more rapidly in 2018. In January 2018, it was reported that LG Electronics had obtained a design patent for a folding smartphone. Later in June, it was reported that Microsoft had been developing a similar device as part of its Surface line, codenamed \"Andromeda\" (itself a spiritual successor to a dual-screen booklet tablet prototype Microsoft had been exploring in the late-2000s known as Courier), while Samsung was also said to be developing such a device. In November 2018, the Chinese startup Royole released the first commercially available foldable smartphone with an OLED display, the Royole Flexpai. It featured a single 7.8-inch display that folds outwards, leaving the display exposed when folded. Later that month at its developers' conference, Samsung officially teased a prototype of its folding smartphone, which would be produced \"in the coming months\". The prototype used a booklet-style layout, with an \"InfinityFlex\" display located on the inside of the device, and a smaller \"cover\" screen on the front of the device to allow access when the screen is closed. At a concurrent developers' summit, Android VP of engineering Dave Burke stated that the next version of the platform would provide enhancements and guidance relevant to folding devices, leveraging existing features.", "The prototype used a booklet-style layout, with an \"InfinityFlex\" display located on the inside of the device, and a smaller \"cover\" screen on the front of the device to allow access when the screen is closed.

In January 2019, Xiaomi CEO Lin Bin published a video on Sina Weibo, featuring him demonstrating a prototype smartphone with two flaps capable of being folded inward. Samsung officially unveiled the Galaxy Fold during its media event at Mobile World Congress in February 2019. Alongside the Galaxy Fold, the convention also saw other foldable phones being unveiled or teased, such as the Huawei Mate X, and TCL presenting various prototype concepts featuring its \"DragonHinge\" technology (including a bracelet-styled device). LG did not unveil a folding device, citing a desire to focus more on re-gaining market share in the smartphone market. It did, however, unveil a \"Dual Screen\" case accessory for its LG V50 smartphone\u2014a folio-styled case containing a secondary display panel inside.

Other companies expressed interest in the concept, or have received patents on designs (such as hinge implementations and overall designs) relating to foldable phones. Motorola Mobility had received patents for a horizontal folding smartphone reminiscent of clamshell feature phones. In April 2019, the impending launch of the Galaxy Fold was met with quality concerns from critics, after widespread reports of review units experiencing varying forms of display failure (in some instances caused by accidental removal of a plastic layer meant to protect the screen in lieu of glass, along with other failures). Samsung indefinitely postponed the device's release, stating that it needed time to investigate the failures and improve the device's durability. Huawei also delayed its Huawei Mate X, with the company citing its desire to take a \"cautious\" approach due to the Samsung Galaxy Fold. In November 2019, Motorola unveiled its horizontal-folding Razr\u2014inspired by its former Razr feature phone line released on 6 February 2020.

There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures. In the Western tradition, the three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of \"the arts\". Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts. The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics. The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.", "The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics. The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art. == Overview == In the perspective of the history of art, artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early prehistoric art to contemporary art; however, some theorists think that the typical concept of \"artistic works\" does not fit well outside modern Western societies. One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to \"skill\" or \"craft\", as associated with words such as \"artisan\". English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology. Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art. Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art, while Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational.", "Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. In Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe. Renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space. In the east, Islamic art's rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns, calligraphy, and architecture. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines.", "Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, Tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but Ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century. The western Age of Enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as Blake's portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or David's propagandistic paintings.", "Woodblock printing became important in Japan after the 17th century.

This led to Romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of Goethe. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as academic art, Symbolism, impressionism and fauvism among others. The history of 20th-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of Impressionism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art.", "cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by Matisse. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like Communism and Post-Modernism exerting a powerful influence. Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. Theodor W. Adorno said in 1970, \"It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.\" Relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony.", "Theodor W. Adorno said in 1970, \"It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.\" Relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones. In The Origin of the Work of Art, Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher and seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which \"that which is\" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed. Historically, art and artistic skills and ideas have often been spread through trade.", "Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed. Historically, art and artistic skills and ideas have often been spread through trade. An example of this is the Silk Road, where Hellenistic, Iranian, Indian and Chinese influences could mix. Greco Buddhist art is one of the most vivid examples of this interaction. The meeting of different cultures and worldviews also influenced artistic creation. An example of this is the multicultural port metropolis of Trieste at the beginning of the 20th century, where James Joyce met writers from Central Europe and the artistic development of New York City as a cultural melting pot. == Forms, genres, media, and styles == The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media, genre, styles, and form. Art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance.", "== Forms, genres, media, and styles == The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media, genre, styles, and form. Art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., figurae), such as color, contour, dimension, medium, melody, space, texture, and value. Form may also include Design principles, such as arrangement, balance, contrast, emphasis, harmony, proportion, proximity, and rhythm. In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context. Extreme Formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties.", "Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form. Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content\u2014i.e., denotations and connotations\u2014while others prefer terms like meaning and significance. Extreme Intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded. It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented, and the content as the artist's experience of that subject. For example, the composition of Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne is partly borrowed from the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. As evidenced by the title, the subject is Napoleon, and the content is Ingres's representation of Napoleon as \"Emperor-God beyond time and space\". Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant.", "As evidenced by the title, the subject is Napoleon, and the content is Ingres's representation of Napoleon as \"Emperor-God beyond time and space\". Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is \"socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise\". Finally, the developing theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. Art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art. === Skill and craft === Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium.", "Art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art. === Skill and craft === Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium. Art can also refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations. There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes. A common view is that the epithet art, particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. Rembrandt's work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.", "Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art. Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art, while Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the Phaedrus (265a\u2013c), and yet in the Republic wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In Ion, Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the Republic. The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted. With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation.", "Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. Rembrandt's work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, Pablo Picasso, was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled. A common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, Marcel Duchamp's Fountain is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects (\"ready-made\") and exercised no traditionally recognized set of skills. Tracey Emin's My Bed, or Damien Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living follow this example. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans.", "Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands-on works of art. == Purpose == Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of art is \"vague\", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline.", "This does not imply that the purpose of art is \"vague\", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (L\u00e9vi-Strauss). === Non-motivated functions === The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e., no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility. Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm. Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm.", "Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. \u2013 Aristotle Experience of the mysterious. Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. \u2013 Albert Einstein Expression of the imagination.", "It is the source of all true art and science. \u2013 Albert Einstein Expression of the imagination. Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else\u2014something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. \u2013 Immanuel Kant Ritualistic and symbolic functions. In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture.", "In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. \u2013 Silva Tomaskova === Motivated functions === Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or used as a form of communication. Communication. Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose.", "Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. \u2013 Steve Mithen Art as entertainment. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer.", "\u2013 Steve Mithen Art as entertainment. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of motion pictures and video games. The Avant-Garde. Art for political change. One of the defining functions of early 20th-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal\u2014Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others\u2014are collectively referred to as the avant-garde arts.By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit.", "Art movements that had this goal\u2014Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others\u2014are collectively referred to as the avant-garde arts.By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Breton (Surrealism) Art as a \"free zone\", removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the avant-garde movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, contemporary art has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction, etc.), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation. Art for social inquiry, subversion or anarchy. While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal.", "Art for social inquiry, subversion or anarchy. While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be used to criticize some aspect of society. Graffiti art and other types of street art are graphics and images that are spray-painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism). Art for social causes. Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of autism, cancer, human trafficking, and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation, human rights in Darfur, murdered and missing Aboriginal women, elder abuse, and pollution.", "For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation\u2014through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals. The more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century. Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer works of art. Within this latter sense, the word art may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill.", "Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of autism, cancer, human trafficking, and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation, human rights in Darfur, murdered and missing Aboriginal women, elder abuse, and pollution. Trashion, using trash to make fashion, practiced by artists such as Marina DeBris is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution. Art for psychological and healing purposes. Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy. The Diagnostic Drawing Series, for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.", "The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy. Art for propaganda, or commercialism. Art is often used as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object. Art as a fitness indicator. It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment.", "Art as a fitness indicator. It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One evolutionary psychology explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the peacock's tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also Fisherian runaway and handicap principle). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionarily important because it attracted mates. The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.", "For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game. == Steps == Art can be divided into any number of steps one can make an argument for. This section divides the creative process into broad three steps, but there is no consensus on an exact number. === Preparation === In the first step, the artist envisions the art in their mind. By imagining what their art would look like, the artist begins the process of bringing the art into existence. Preparation of art may involve approaching and researching the subject matter. Artistic inspiration is one of the main drivers of art, and may be considered to stem from instinct, impressions, and feelings.", "Preparation of art may involve approaching and researching the subject matter. Artistic inspiration is one of the main drivers of art, and may be considered to stem from instinct, impressions, and feelings. === Creation === In the second step, the artist executes the creation of their work. The creation of a piece can be affected by factors such as the artist's mood, surroundings, and mental state. For example, The Black Paintings by Francisco de Goya, created in the elder years of his life, are thought to be so bleak because he was in isolation and because of his experience with war. He painted them directly on the walls of his apartment in Spain, and most likely never discussed them with anyone. The Beatles stated drugs such as LSD and cannabis influenced some of their greatest hits, such as Revolver. Trial and error are considered an integral part of the creation process.", "The Beatles stated drugs such as LSD and cannabis influenced some of their greatest hits, such as Revolver. Trial and error are considered an integral part of the creation process. === Appreciation === The last step is art appreciation, which has the sub-topic of critique. In one study, over half of visual arts students agreed that reflection is an essential step of the art process. According to education journals, the reflection of art is considered an essential part of the experience. However an important aspect of art is that others may view and appreciate it as well. While many focus on whether those viewing/listening/etc. believe the art to be good/successful or not, art has profound value beyond its commercial success as a provider of information and health in society.", "While many focus on whether those viewing/listening/etc. believe the art to be good/successful or not, art has profound value beyond its commercial success as a provider of information and health in society. Art enjoyment can bring about a wide spectrum of emotion due to beauty. Some art is meant to be practical, with its analysis studious, meant to stimulate discourse. == Public access == Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society. Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite, though other forms of art may have been.", "Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite, though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as moulds made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality Ancient Roman pottery and Greek Tanagra figurines to a very wide market. Cylinder seals were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the Ancient Near East. Once coins were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society. Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when printmaking began with small woodcuts, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations. Popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.", "Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations. Popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries. In 1661, the city of Basel, in Switzerland, opened the first public museum of art in the world, the Kunstmuseum Basel. Today, its collection is distinguished by an impressively wide historic span, from the early 15th century up to the immediate present. Its various areas of emphasis give it international standing as one of the most significant museums of its kind. These encompass: paintings and drawings by artists active in the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600, and on the art of the 19th to 21st centuries. Public buildings and monuments, secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.", "Public buildings and monuments, secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. Egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside. Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the Orleans Collection mostly housed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British Royal Collection remains distinct, but large donations such as the Old Royal Library were made from it to the British Museum, established in 1753. The Uffizi in Florence opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before. The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in Vienna, Munich and other capitals.", "Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer works of art. Within this latter sense, the word art may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (art as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks (art as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience). Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as Kant, the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression. Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art.", "The Uffizi in Florence opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before. The building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. The opening of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre during the French Revolution (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established. Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. However, museums do not only provide availability to art, but do also influence the way art is being perceived by the audience, as studies found. Thus, the museum itself is not only a blunt stage for the presentation of art, but plays an active and vital role in the overall perception of art in modern society. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for example, was created by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.", "Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses.

But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status. There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is \"necessary to present something more than mere objects\" said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art, video art, and conceptual art. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was an idea, it could not be bought and sold. \"Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s.", "The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was an idea, it could not be bought and sold. \"Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object.\" In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works, invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. \"With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors.\" == Controversies == Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view.", "The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. \"With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors.\" == Controversies == Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. Iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. Aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Muhammad remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics, though often much less so by a wider public. The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus.", "Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics, though often much less so by a wider public. The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus. The Last Judgment by Michelangelo was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of decorum through nudity and the Apollo-like pose of Christ. The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of Romanticism, and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault's Raft of the Medusa (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. \u00c9douard Manet's Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.", "1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. \u00c9douard Manet's Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world. John Singer Sargent's Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam X) (1884), caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation. The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the 20th century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.", "Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts. == Theory == Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries. This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art. The aesthetic theorist John Ruskin, who championed what he saw as the naturalism of J. M. W. Turner, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.", "W. Turner, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature. The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. Richard Wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the Realist, whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the Objectivist, whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the Relativist position, whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans. === Arrival of Modernism === The arrival of Modernism in the late 19th century led to a radical break in the conception of the function of art, and then again in the late 20th century with the advent of postmodernism. Clement Greenberg's 1960 article \"Modernist Painting\" defines modern art as \"the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself\". Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting: Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting\u2014the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment\u2014were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly.", "Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting: Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting\u2014the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment\u2014were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly. After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as Michael Fried, T. J. Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century. Pop artists like Andy Warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the art world.", "Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century. Pop artists like Andy Warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the art world. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond high art to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography. Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind-everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction. There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. In The Invention of Art: A Cultural History, Larry Shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts, i.e. fine art.", "Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent. The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as \"one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture\".", "In The Invention of Art: A Cultural History, Larry Shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts, i.e. fine art. He finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity; for example, Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art, but techne. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music, but also cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming, etc. === New Criticism and the \"intentional fallacy\" === Following Duchamp during the first half of the 20th century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.", "This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist. In 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled \"The Intentional Fallacy\", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention, or \"intended meaning\" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting. In another essay, \"The Affective Fallacy\", which served as a kind of sister essay to \"The Intentional Fallacy\" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics.", "This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, Stanley Fish, was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his 1970 essay \"Literature in the Reader\". As summarized by Berys Gaut and Paisley Livingston in their essay \"The Creation of Art\": \"Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic.\" These authors contend that: \"Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work.\" Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: \"Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works.\" They quote Richard Wollheim as stating that, \"The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself.\" === \"Linguistic turn\" and its debate === The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the \"innocent eye debate\" in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art. Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the structuralism of Ferdinand de Saussure and the ensuing movement of poststructuralism. In 1981, the artist Mark Tansey created a work of art titled The Innocent Eye as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century.", "Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the structuralism of Ferdinand de Saussure and the ensuing movement of poststructuralism. In 1981, the artist Mark Tansey created a work of art titled The Innocent Eye as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by Hayden White. The fact that language is not a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of philosophy of language which originated in the works of Johann Georg Hamann and Wilhelm von Humboldt. Ernst Gombrich and Nelson Goodman in his book Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s. He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist Roger Sperry who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.", "He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist Roger Sperry who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives. == Classification disputes == Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings, Duchamp's Fountain, the movies, J. S. G. Boggs' superlative imitations of banknotes, conceptual art, and video games. Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem.", "Boggs' superlative imitations of banknotes, conceptual art, and video games. Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, \"the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life\" are \"so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art.\" According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst's and Emin's work by arguing \"For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all\" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work. In 1998, Arthur Danto, suggested a thought experiment showing that \"the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood.\" Anti-art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art; it is a term associated with Dadaism and attributed to Marcel Duchamp just before World War I, when he was making art from found objects. One of these, Fountain (1917), an ordinary urinal, has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art.", "Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood.\" Anti-art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art; it is a term associated with Dadaism and attributed to Marcel Duchamp just before World War I, when he was making art from found objects. One of these, Fountain (1917), an ordinary urinal, has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art. Anti-art is a feature of work by Situationist International, the lo-fi Mail art movement, and the Young British Artists, though it is a form still rejected by the Stuckists, who describe themselves as anti-anti-art. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example. === Value judgment === Somewhat in relation to the above, the word art is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as \"that meal was a work of art\" (the cook is an artist), or \"the art of deception\" (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive.", "Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, \"good\" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, Francisco Goya's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3 May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage.", "For example, Francisco Goya's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3 May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'. The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings.", "Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human. By extension, it has been argued by Emily L. Spratt that the development of generative artificial intelligence, especially in regard to artificial intelligence art, necessitates a re-evaluation of aesthetic theory in art history today and a reconsideration of the limits of human creativity. Music and artificial intelligence has taken a similar path. So too has the use of large language models in generating creative texts.", "The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent. The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as \"one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture\". Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle. Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another. Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.", "Music and artificial intelligence has taken a similar path. So too has the use of large language models in generating creative texts. == Art and law == An essential legal issue are art forgeries, plagiarism, replicas and works that are strongly based on other works of art. Intellectual property law plays a significant role in the art world. Copyright protection is granted to artists for their original works, providing them with exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and display their creations. This safeguard empowers artists to govern the usage of their work and safeguard against unauthorized copying or infringement. The trade in works of art or the export from a country may be subject to legal regulations. Internationally there are also extensive efforts to protect the works of art created.", "The trade in works of art or the export from a country may be subject to legal regulations. Internationally there are also extensive efforts to protect the works of art created. The UN, UNESCO and Blue Shield International try to ensure effective protection at the national level and to intervene directly in the event of armed conflicts or disasters. This can particularly affect museums, archives, art collections and excavation sites. This should also secure the economic basis of a country, especially because works of art are often of tourist importance. The founding president of Blue Shield International, Karl von Habsburg, explained an additional connection between the destruction of cultural property and the cause of flight during a mission in Lebanon in April 2019: \"Cultural goods are part of the identity of the people who live in a certain place. If you destroy their culture, you also destroy their identity.

On 5 March 2015, the Islamic State (IS) reportedly started the demolition of Nimrud, an Assyrian city from the 13th century BC. The local palace was bulldozed, while lamassu statues at the gates of the palace of Ashurnasirpal II were smashed. A video showing the destruction of Nimrud was released in April 2015. By the time the city was retaken by government forces, 90% of the excavated zone of Nimrud, including Ashurbanipal II's palace, the ziggurat, and its Lamassu statues had been completely destroyed. Since the city's destruction, The Nimrud Rescue Project, funded by the Smithsonian, has worked two seasons on location to train local Iraqi archaeologists and protect and conserve the remains. So far the project has largely been successful in documenting and collecting the remaining artifacts and reliefs; plans for reconstruction are also in the works.", "Since the city's destruction, The Nimrud Rescue Project, funded by the Smithsonian, has worked two seasons on location to train local Iraqi archaeologists and protect and conserve the remains.

More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation. George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as \"the art world\" has conferred \"the status of candidate for appreciation\".

Sculptures, cave paintings, rock paintings and petroglyphs from the Upper Paleolithic dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The first undisputed sculptures and similar art pieces, like the Venus of Hohle Fels, are the numerous objects found at the Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura UNESCO World Heritage Site, where the oldest non-stationary works of human art yet discovered were found, in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines, in addition to the oldest musical instruments unearthed so far, with the artifacts dating between 43,000 and 35,000 BC, so being the first centre of human art. Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya, and Olmec. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.", "Shockwave cosmology is a non-standard cosmology proposed by Joel Smoller and Blake Temple in 2003. In this model, the \u201cbig bang\u201d is an explosion inside a black hole, producing the expanding volume of space and matter that includes the observable universe. == Integration with general relativity == Smoller and Temple integrate shock waves into Einstein's general relativity. This produces a universe that \"looks essentially identical to the aftermath of the big bang\" according to cosmologists Barnes and Lewis. They explain that Smoller and Temple's version is distinguished from the big bang only by there being a shockwave at the leading edge of an explosion \u2013 one that, for Smoller and Temple's model, must be beyond the observable universe. However, Barnes and Lewis do not support shockwave cosmology because they see it as not testable; they point out that there is no explosion in the standard theory of the Big Bang. == Current and future state of the universe == From Smoller and Temple's calculations, we are still inside an expanding black hole. The configuration of 'flat' spacetime (see Minkowski space) inside a black hole, also occurs during the moments of the formation of a black hole from a collapsing star.", "== Current and future state of the universe == From Smoller and Temple's calculations, we are still inside an expanding black hole. The configuration of 'flat' spacetime (see Minkowski space) inside a black hole, also occurs during the moments of the formation of a black hole from a collapsing star. Eventually, according to shockwave cosmology, the mass of our expanding volume of space and matter will fall in density as it expands. At some point, the event horizon of the black hole will cease to be. An outside observer will then see it appear as a white hole. The matter would then continue to expand. == Alternative to dark energy == In related work, Smoller, Temple, and Vogler propose that this shockwave may have resulted in our part of the universe having a lower density than that surrounding it, causing the accelerated expansion normally attributed to dark energy. They also propose that this related theory could be tested: a universe with dark energy should give a figure for the cubic correction to redshift versus luminosity C = \u22120.180 at a = a whereas for Smoller, Temple, and Vogler's alternative C should be positive rather than negative.", "== Alternative to dark energy == In related work, Smoller, Temple, and Vogler propose that this shockwave may have resulted in our part of the universe having a lower density than that surrounding it, causing the accelerated expansion normally attributed to dark energy.

They give a more precise calculation for their wave model alternative as: the cubic correction to redshift versus luminosity at a = a is C = 0.359. == Comparison with standard cosmology == Although shockwave cosmology produces a universe that \"looks essentially identical to the aftermath of the big bang\", cosmologists consider that it needs further development before it could be considered as a more advantageous model than the big bang theory (or standard model) in explaining the universe. In particular, and especially for the proposed alternative to dark energy, it would need to explain big bang nucleosynthesis, the quantitative details of the microwave background anisotropies, the Lyman-alpha forest, and galaxy surveys. == References ==", "In psychology, a distinction is often made between two types of love: Passionate love, also called infatuation, is \"a state of intense longing for union with another. Reciprocated love (union with the other) is associated with fulfillment and ecstasy; unrequited love (separation) is associated with emptiness, anxiety, or despair\", and \"the overwhelming, amorous feeling for one individual that is typically most intense during the early stage of love (i.e., when individuals are not (yet) in a relationship with their beloved or are in a new relationship)\". Companionate love, also called attachment, is \"the affection we feel for those with whom our lives are deeply entwined\", and \"the comforting feeling of emotional bonding with another individual that takes some time to develop, often in the context of a romantic relationship\". Evolutionary theories suggest these two types of love exist for different purposes, and research from psychology and biology suggests they follow somewhat different mechanics. Both passionate and companionate love can contribute to relationship satisfaction. Passionate and companionate love can also be further distinguished from a third important type of love, compassionate love, which is love focused on caring about others. Passionate love is also commonly called \"romantic love\" in some literature, especially fields of biology, but the term \"passionate love\" is most common in psychology. Academic literature on love has never adopted a universal terminology.", "Passionate love is also commonly called \"romantic love\" in some literature, especially fields of biology, but the term \"passionate love\" is most common in psychology. Academic literature on love has never adopted a universal terminology. Other terms compared to passionate love are \"being in love\", having a crush, obsessive love, limerence and eros. Companionate love is commonly called \"attachment\" or compared to strong liking, friendship love or storge. This is usually considered the same as the \"attachment system\" from attachment theory, but not all authors agree. == Passionate love == Passionate love feelings are most commonly measured by psychologists with a questionnaire called the Passionate Love Scale (PLS). In the PLS form, Elaine Hatfield & Susan Sprecher specify the components of passionate love as: Passionate love is linked to passion, as in intense emotion, for example, joy and fulfillment, but also anguish and agony. Hatfield notes that the original meaning of passion \"was agony\u2014as in Christ's passion.\" Rather than being an emotion itself, passionate love is said to be a motivational state which produces different emotions depending on the situation (e.g.", "=== Attachment === Langeslag et al.'s Attachment Scale (analogous to companionate love) has items asking about: Feeling that one can count on the beloved. Being prepared to share one's possessions with the beloved. Feeling lonely without the beloved. Feeling that the beloved is the one for them. The beloved knowing everything about them. Hoping one's feelings for the beloved never end. Feeling emotionally connected to the beloved. The beloved being able to reassure them when they are upset.", "Feeling emotionally connected to the beloved. The beloved being able to reassure them when they are upset. The beloved being the person who can make them feel the happiest. The beloved being part of their plans for the future. === Relation to attachment theory === Companionate love is sometimes considered the same as the \"attachment\" referred to by attachment theory. John Bowlby's original concept of an \"attachment system\" referred to a system evolved to keep infants in proximity of their caregiver (or \"attachment figure\"). The person uses the attachment figure as a \"secure base\" to feel safe exploring the environment, seeks proximity with the attachment figure when threatened, and suffers distress when separated. A prominent theory suggests this system is reused for adult pair bonds, as an exaptation or co-option, whereby a given trait takes on a new purpose.", "The person uses the attachment figure as a \"secure base\" to feel safe exploring the environment, seeks proximity with the attachment figure when threatened, and suffers distress when separated. A prominent theory suggests this system is reused for adult pair bonds, as an exaptation or co-option, whereby a given trait takes on a new purpose. However, companionate love has also been characterized as being more like strong friendship, and Ellen Berscheid suggests that it's unproven whether all adult relationships are attachments in the sense meant by attachment theory. Berscheid writes that the assumption that romantic partners are each other's attachment figures is \"in dire need of empirical scrutiny.\" == Timeline == While passionate love is sometimes associated with the phenomenon of love at first sight, not everyone falls in love quickly or suddenly. In one study of Chinese and American participants, 38% fell in love fast and 35% fell in love slowly, and in another study of Iranians, 70% fell in love slowly or very slowly. A popular hypothesis suggests that passionate love turns into companionate love over time in a relationship, but other accounts suggest that while companionate love takes longer to develop, it is important at the beginning of a relationship as well. Companionate love might also precede passionate love sometimes. There is some reason to think attachment takes about two years to develop, for example one study found that participants who had been in a relationship for about this long named their romantic partner as an attachment figure, while other participants named a parent.", "Companionate love might also precede passionate love sometimes. There is some reason to think attachment takes about two years to develop, for example one study found that participants who had been in a relationship for about this long named their romantic partner as an attachment figure, while other participants named a parent. One estimate for the duration of passionate love is 18 months to 3 years, which comes from survey data collected by Dorothy Tennov, for her 1979 book Love and Limerence. Another estimate comes from a 1999 experiment performed by Donatelli Marazziti and colleagues which found a difference in blood serotonin levels between newly in love people and controls, and found these levels had returned to normal after 12 to 18 months. Intense attraction can also last much longer in rarer cases, as in the phenomenon of long-term intense romantic love. These lovers tend to show lower levels of obsession than in the early stage, however. Companionate love is thought to build over time as a relationship progresses, but then decrease very slowly over the course of several decades. In the past, some have thought companionate love to be stable after it develops, but for example one study of new marriages found a decline after a 1-year period.", "Companionate love is thought to build over time as a relationship progresses, but then decrease very slowly over the course of several decades. In the past, some have thought companionate love to be stable after it develops, but for example one study of new marriages found a decline after a 1-year period. == Causal conditions == A number of theories exist about the causal conditions surrounding these types of love (i.e. who people feel a certain love towards and when), but authors generally agree that passionate and companionate love follow different mechanics. Companionate love generally increases with liking and familiarity, but the circumstances surrounding passionate love are more complicated. Studies show that love and conflict can sit side-by-side in a relationship, and passionate love in particular is even said to be amplified by negative emotions. === Liking === According to Ellen Berscheid, companionate love \"follows the pleasure-pain principle; we like those who reward us and dislike those who punish us.\" Examples of factors include similarity, familiarity, expressions of self-esteem and validation one's self-worth, physical attraction and mutual self-disclosures. Also, while passionate love is often said to come before companionate love, Berscheid suggests that companionate love can also be a component in the development of passionate love.", "=== Liking === According to Ellen Berscheid, companionate love \"follows the pleasure-pain principle; we like those who reward us and dislike those who punish us.\" Examples of factors include similarity, familiarity, expressions of self-esteem and validation one's self-worth, physical attraction and mutual self-disclosures. Also, while passionate love is often said to come before companionate love, Berscheid suggests that companionate love can also be a component in the development of passionate love. === Sexual desire === Authors disagree on the role sexual desire plays in the development of romantic love. Passionate love is often associated with sexual desire, for example Ellen Berscheid suggests that one possible account of passionate love is \"a felicitous combination of companionate love and sexual desire.\" However, Lisa Diamond has suggested that while sexual desire is often a causal component, passionate love can occur outside the context of sexual desire. Diamond's argument rests on various reports and historical accounts, as well as an evolutionary argument that the brain systems underlying romantic love evolved independent of sexual orientation. Diamond thinks that time spent together and physical touch can act as a \"stand-in\" for sexual desire and facilitate romantic love between partners regardless of their sexual orientation. Helen Fisher has argued that passionate love is related to the phenomenon of mammalian courtship attraction, or mate choice, and that people have certain preferences for choosing a preferred mating partner that determines who they fall in love with. However, Fisher argues this type of attraction is distinct from the sex drive, although they are interrelated.", "Helen Fisher has argued that passionate love is related to the phenomenon of mammalian courtship attraction, or mate choice, and that people have certain preferences for choosing a preferred mating partner that determines who they fall in love with. However, Fisher argues this type of attraction is distinct from the sex drive, although they are interrelated. === Emotional arousal === Ellen Berscheid writes that emotional arousal, such as happy surprises, contributes to eliciting passionate feelings. Surprise and uncertainty tend to be more of a characteristic of new relationships because more established partners tend to behave as expected, thus rarely generating this sort of arousal. Helen Fisher recommends doing novel and exciting things together to ignite passion. In an experiment by Arthur Aron & Christina Norman, couples doing an exciting task (as opposed to a boring one) experienced increased feelings of relationship satisfaction and romantic love. Elaine Hatfield has even suggested that negative or mixed emotions can amplify feelings of passionate love. In A New Look at Love, she writes \"Passion demands physical arousal and unpleasant experiences are just as arousing as pleasant ones.\" Hatfield cites animal studies, such as one study in which puppies that were inconsistently either rewarded or maltreated were the most attracted to and dependent on their trainer.", "Elaine Hatfield has even suggested that negative or mixed emotions can amplify feelings of passionate love. In A New Look at Love, she writes \"Passion demands physical arousal and unpleasant experiences are just as arousing as pleasant ones.\" Hatfield cites animal studies, such as one study in which puppies that were inconsistently either rewarded or maltreated were the most attracted to and dependent on their trainer. People who behave consistently generate little emotion, she says, and \"What would generate a spark of interest, however, is if our admiring friend suddenly started treating us with contempt\u2014or if our arch enemy started inundating us with kindness.\" === Intimacy === Another theory is that passion occurs when a rapid increase in intimacy occurs. A similar theory, by Arthur Aron & Elaine Aron, states that passion occurs in the context of a rapid self-expansion of the self and the inclusion of the qualities of the beloved into one's self-concept. With both of these theories, it's predicted that passion wanes in a relationship as partners get to know each other and the increase in intimacy tends to stabilize. === Love regulation === Love regulation is \"the use of behavioral or cognitive strategies to change the intensity of current feelings of romantic love.\" In some cases, love feelings may be stronger than desired such as after a breakup, or love feelings may be weaker than desired such as when they decline throughout a long-term relationship. Sandra Langeslag notes that it's a common misconception that love feelings are uncontrollable, or even should not be controlled; however studies have shown that love regulation is possible and may be useful. For example, looking at pictures of the beloved has been shown to increase feelings of infatuation (i.e.", "Sandra Langeslag notes that it's a common misconception that love feelings are uncontrollable, or even should not be controlled; however studies have shown that love regulation is possible and may be useful. For example, looking at pictures of the beloved has been shown to increase feelings of infatuation (i.e. passionate love) and attachment (i.e. companionate love). In another technique called cognitive reappraisal, one focuses on positive or negative aspects of the beloved, the relationship, or imagined future scenarios: In negative reappraisal, one focuses on negative qualities of the beloved (\"he's lazy\", \"she's always late\"), the relationship (\"we fight a lot\") or imagined future scenarios (\"he'll cheat on me\"). Negative reappraisal decreases feelings of infatuation and attachment, but decreases mood in the short term. Langeslag has recommended distraction as an antidote to the short-term decrease in mood. Negative reappraisal can be useful, for example, to those who want to ameliorate heartbreak or put an end to an abusive relationship.", "Langeslag has recommended distraction as an antidote to the short-term decrease in mood. Negative reappraisal can be useful, for example, to those who want to ameliorate heartbreak or put an end to an abusive relationship. In positive reappraisal, one focuses on positive qualities of the beloved (\"he's kind\", \"she's spontaneous\"), the relationship (\"we have so much fun together\") or imagined future scenarios (\"we'll live happily ever after\"). Positive reappraisal increases attachment and can increase relationship satisfaction, which could, for example, help stabilize a long-term relationship. Love regulation does not switch feelings on or off immediately, so Langeslag recommends, for example, writing a list of things once a day to feel a lasting change. == Biology == Passionate and companionate love are thought to be interrelated but involve different brain systems and serve different purposes. Passionate love is thought to have evolved for mate choice or to initiate a pair bond, while companionate love is for maintaining a pair bond, maintaining close proximity and affiliative behaviors. Passionate love is often associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine.", "In the PLS form, Elaine Hatfield & Susan Sprecher specify the components of passionate love as: Passionate love is linked to passion, as in intense emotion, for example, joy and fulfillment, but also anguish and agony. Hatfield notes that the original meaning of passion \"was agony\u2014as in Christ's passion.\" Rather than being an emotion itself, passionate love is said to be a motivational state which produces different emotions depending on the situation (e.g. joy when requited, and sadness when unrequited). A 2014 study of Iranian young adults found that the early stage of romantic love was associated with the brighter side of hypomania (elation, mental and physical activity, and positive social interaction) and better sleep quality, but also stronger symptoms of depression and anxiety. The authors conclude that romantic love is \"not entirely a joyful and happy period of life\". Passionate love is said to usually only be present (or the most intense) in the early stage of love, when a relationship is new or before a relationship has started. However, in a rare phenomenon called long-term intense romantic love, intense attraction can remain for much longer than is typical, even for 10 years or more. In contemporary literature, the original characteristics of passionate love are seen to some degree as being a mixture of things.", "Passionate love is thought to have evolved for mate choice or to initiate a pair bond, while companionate love is for maintaining a pair bond, maintaining close proximity and affiliative behaviors. Passionate love is often associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine. Companionate love is often associated with the neuropeptide oxytocin, and sometimes vasopressin or endogenous opioids. Passionate love is sometimes compared to addiction, although there are differences. People in the early stages of romantic love share similar traits with addicts (for example, feeling rushes of euphoria, or craving for their beloved), but this tends to wear off over time, while the condition of a drug addiction tends to worsen. Helen Fisher has suggested romantic love is a \"positive addiction\" (i.e. not harmful) when reciprocated and a \"negative addiction\" when unrequited or inappropriate. == See also == == References == === Bibliography === == External links == The Passionate Love Scale at Helen Fisher and Lucy Brown's website.", "However, in a rare phenomenon called long-term intense romantic love, intense attraction can remain for much longer than is typical, even for 10 years or more. In contemporary literature, the original characteristics of passionate love are seen to some degree as being a mixture of things. For example, it's been determined that the PLS has questions which measure companionate love, which led Sandra Langeslag and colleagues to develop the Infatuation and Attachment Scales (IAS) as a newer measure of passionate and companionate love. The PLS also measures an obsessional element which is distinguishable in that it's possible to experience love feelings (and even intense attraction) with lower levels of obsession. Finally, while Elaine Hatfield originally described passionate love as having a component of sexual attraction, contemporary authors generally agree that sexual attraction and romantic attraction are distinct.

Participants who were not in a relationship scored the highest on infatuation. The word \"infatuation\" is also sometimes used colloquially in contrast with \"love\", but Elaine Hatfield has argued that the only difference between infatuation (in this sense) and passionate love is semantic.", "Participants who were not in a relationship scored the highest on infatuation. The word \"infatuation\" is also sometimes used colloquially in contrast with \"love\", but Elaine Hatfield has argued that the only difference between infatuation (in this sense) and passionate love is semantic. Albert Ellis and Robert Harper conducted interviews and concluded that the only difference is that people use the word \"infatuation\" in hindsight to refer to a relationship after it ends and \"love\" to refer to a relationship still in progress. Hatfield suggests that when parents and friends say somebody is \"just infatuated\" they're just saying they don't approve of the relationship. === Obsession === Passionate love is described as having an obsessional element characterized by intrusive thinking, uncertainty, and mood swings. Intrusive thinking (or obsessive thinking) is a component of early-stage romantic love. One study found that on average people in love spent 65% of their waking hours thinking of their loved one. Studies by Bianca Acevedo & Arthur Aron found that the obsessional component of the PLS can be separated from the non-obsessional component.", "One study found that on average people in love spent 65% of their waking hours thinking of their loved one. Studies by Bianca Acevedo & Arthur Aron found that the obsessional component of the PLS can be separated from the non-obsessional component. Items on the PLS measuring obsession are, for example, \"Sometimes I feel I can't control my thoughts; they are obsessively on my partner\", \"I sometimes find it difficult to concentrate on work because thoughts of my partner occupy my mind\" and \"I get extremely depressed when things don't go right in my relationship with my partner.\" Items on the PLS measuring non-obsessional romantic love are, for example, \"I want my partner\u2014physically, emotionally, and mentally\", \"For me, my partner is the perfect romantic partner\", \"I would rather be with my partner than anyone else\" and \"I possess a powerful attraction for my partner\". In Acevedo & Aron's analysis, passionate love with obsession was associated with increased relationship satisfaction only in short-term relationships. Romantic obsession was associated with slightly decreased satisfaction in the long-term. Another meta-analysis by James Graham found a strong association between romantic obsession (using the mania love attitude\u2014similar in concept to the PLS obsession factor described by Acevedo & Aron) and decreased satisfaction over time. These authors (Acevedo & Aron, Graham) have speculated that continued romantic obsession within a relationship could be connected to attachment style. Attachment style refers to differences in attachment-related thoughts and behaviors, especially relating to the concept of security vs.", "These authors (Acevedo & Aron, Graham) have speculated that continued romantic obsession within a relationship could be connected to attachment style. Attachment style refers to differences in attachment-related thoughts and behaviors, especially relating to the concept of security vs. insecurity. This can be split into components of anxiety (worrying the partner is available, attentive and responsive) and avoidance (preference not to rely on others or open up emotionally). It has been suggested that attachment style forms during childhood and adolescence, but twin studies have also suggested a heritable component, and attachment anxiety is correlated with the personality trait neuroticism. People can also have different attachment styles with different partners, for example an avoidant partner can cause a secure partner to feel and act anxious. === Positive illusions === Idealization (perceiving the beloved in the most positive way, or overlooking their faults) is a form of positive illusions. A 1996 study of couples who had been dating for 19 months and couples who had been married for 6.5 years found that \"Individuals were happier in their relationships when they idealized their partners and their partners idealized them.\" A brain scan experiment also found that couples who were still in love after four years (as compared to those who weren't) showed activation in a region associated with suspending negative judgment and over-evaluating a partner.", "=== Positive illusions === Idealization (perceiving the beloved in the most positive way, or overlooking their faults) is a form of positive illusions.

While Elaine Hatfield and others have traditionally associated idealization with passionate love, studies on positive illusions have looked at couples in varied stages of their relationships, including long-term couples. == Companionate love == Companionate love is said to be felt less intensely than passionate love, consisting more of gentle affection which is felt when things are going well. Elaine Hatfield writes that companionate love is \"a steady burning fire, fueled by delightful experiences but extinguished by painful ones\" Companionate love is more about long-term relationships, and Hatfield emphasizes partner compatibility as being important. Ellen Berscheid comments that companionate love \"may be the 'staff of life' for many relationships and a better basis for a satisfying marriage than romantic love.\" Companionate love is linked to intimacy and Hatfield suggests that intimate relationships have these characteristics: Companionate love is usually considered the same as storge, although James Graham has argued on the basis of a meta-analytic factor analysis that the storge love attitude most corresponds to practical friendship which lacks qualities of companionate love (such as intimacy and commitment). === Attachment === Langeslag et al.'s Attachment Scale (analogous to companionate love) has items asking about: Feeling that one can count on the beloved.

They play a role in maintaining the charge balance of the atmosphere. The main components of air are molecular nitrogen and oxygen. Due to the strong electronegativity of oxygen and oxygen-containing molecules, they can easily capture electrons to form negatively charged air ions, most of which are superoxide radicals \u00b7O2\u2212, so NAI are mainly composed of negative oxygen ions, also called air negative oxygen ions. The ions can be produced by natural means such as lightning, or artificially by methods such as a corona discharge. They can play a role in electrostatic removal of air particulates both for industrial applications and with indoor air, and there are claims that they have a beneficial health effect although the evidence for this is weak. == Generation mechanism == Various negative air ions are formed by combining active neutral molecules and electrons in the gas through a series of ion-molecule reactions. In the air, due to the presence of many water molecules, the negative air ions typically combine with water to form hydrated negative air ions, such as O\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, O2\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, O3\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, OH\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, CO3\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, HCO3\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, CO4\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, NO2\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, NO3\u2212\u00b7(H2O)n, etc.", "== Generation mechanism == Various negative air ions are formed by combining active neutral molecules and electrons in the gas through a series of ion-molecule reactions.

This is because in the molecular collision, the larger the molecular volume, the less energy is lost when encountering collisions with other molecules, thereby extending the survival time of negative air ions. == Generation methods == Negative air ions can be produced by two methods: natural or artificial. The methods of producing negative air ions in nature include the waterfall effect, lightning ionization and from plants. Natural methods can produce a large number of negative air ions. The artificial means of producing negative air ions include corona discharge and water vapour.", "Natural methods can produce a large number of negative air ions. The artificial means of producing negative air ions include corona discharge and water vapour. Compared with the negative air ions produced in nature, although artificial methods can produce high levels of negative air ions, there are differences in the types and concentrations of negative air ions. === Natural environments === ==== Waterfall method ==== The mechanism of producing negative air ions by the waterfall method connects to the generation of static electricity due to water droplets hitting surfaces, first discovered by Philipp Lenard in 1892 and now called the spray electrification or waterfall effect. Falling water generates static electricity either by collisions between water drops or with the ground, leading to the finer mist in updrafts being mainly negatively charged, with positive near the lower surface. It can also occur for sliding drops. The experimental fact that charging occurs is very well documented, although details of the exact process remain a topic of debate. High speed video observations show how water spray can breakup into different droplets.", "The experimental fact that charging occurs is very well documented, although details of the exact process remain a topic of debate. High speed video observations show how water spray can breakup into different droplets. Larger droplets tend to be positively charged, while smaller ones negative; this charge separation is also well documented for solids. For instance it occurs in commercial powder processing and in natural processes such as dust storms, There can be electric fields of up to 160kV/m with moderate wind conditions, which leads to Coulomb forces of about the same magnitude as gravity. There can also be contributions from contact potential differences between liquids or gases and other materials, similar to the work function differences for solids. It has been suggested that a triboelectric series for liquids is useful. One difference from solids is that often liquids have charged double layers, and most of the work to date supports that ion transfer (rather than electron) dominates for liquids as first suggested by Irving Langmuir in 1938. All these processes will lead to charges, relatively high electric fields and these in turn can lead to the formation of gaseous ions.", "One difference from solids is that often liquids have charged double layers, and most of the work to date supports that ion transfer (rather than electron) dominates for liquids as first suggested by Irving Langmuir in 1938. All these processes will lead to charges, relatively high electric fields and these in turn can lead to the formation of gaseous ions. ==== Lightning strike ==== In the atmosphere positive and negative charges will accumulate above and below the clouds. One of the most commonly cited ways that charge separation is generated is via the collisions of different forms of solid ice, for instance graupel and ice particles. Similar to the collisions between other types of particles mentioned above, the ice particles become positively charged and the graupel negative. The two have different densities, with the ice particles tending to rise and the graupel fall or move towards the center of the storm. This charge separation in different regions of the clouds leads to large electric fields. When the electric field strength between the cloud and the ground or different parts of a storm exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, discharge will occur and break through the air.", "This charge separation in different regions of the clouds leads to large electric fields. When the electric field strength between the cloud and the ground or different parts of a storm exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, discharge will occur and break through the air. During the lightning discharge process, charged particles bombard the surrounding air molecules, ionizing the molecules to generate negative air ions. At the moment of the lightning strike, hundreds of millions of negative air ions will be generated. ==== Plant discharge ==== The leaves of vegetation, particularly indoor plants can lead to ions. The rate is low, can be increased by applying electric fields and there are indications that it can be enhanced at the tips of leaves although there are also physiological factors. The light exposure conditions also play a role, with an exponential dependence on the illumination intensity. Bioreactor have been explored which can produce levels of ions that could be useful for reducing particular contaminants.", "The light exposure conditions also play a role, with an exponential dependence on the illumination intensity. Bioreactor have been explored which can produce levels of ions that could be useful for reducing particular contaminants. === Artificial ionization === ==== Corona discharge method ==== Currently, the most common artificial method is to use corona discharge to produce negative ions. The specific process of using corona discharge to produce gaseous negative ions is to connect the high-voltage negative electrode to a thin needle-shaped wire or a conductor with a very small radius of curvature, so that a strong electric field is generated near the electrode, releasing electrons. The electrons to collide with gas molecules, and produce new free electrons and positive ions. The newly generated free electrons will repeat the previous process, and this process will be repeated. ==== The water vapour method ==== The water vapour method refers to the use of artificial technology and modern instruments to simulate the process of charging via the waterfall effect, using high-speed airflow to collide with water droplets, dispersing larger water droplets into a large number of microdroplets. As the water droplet dispersion occurs, the Leonard effect is active, generating negative ions.", "==== The water vapour method ==== The water vapour method refers to the use of artificial technology and modern instruments to simulate the process of charging via the waterfall effect, using high-speed airflow to collide with water droplets, dispersing larger water droplets into a large number of microdroplets. As the water droplet dispersion occurs, the Leonard effect is active, generating negative ions. The air moving past the water droplets may also lead to triboelectric charging, similar to aircraft \"precipitation static\" or \"P-static\"; aircraft typically have one or more static wicks to remove this. == Detection == Detection of negative air ions is divided into measurement and identification. NAI measurement can be achieved by measuring the change in atmospheric conductivity when NAI pass through a conductive tube. NAI identification is typically performed by mass spectrometry, which can effectively identify a variety of negative ions, including O\u2212,O2\u2212,O3\u2212,CO3\u2212,HCO3\u2212,NO3\u2212, etc. == Application of negative air ions == === Environmental improvement === Negative air ions are a component of electrostatic filters which are used to remove dust and particulate pollutants (PM) both in industry and for indoor pollutants.

It was previously thought that these clusters must dissociate into single cells during metastasis. According to the hypothesis, CTC clusters intravasate (enter the bloodstream), travel through circulation as a cohesive unit, and extravasate (exit the bloodstream) at distant sites without disaggregating, significantly enhancing their metastatic potential. This concept is considered a key advancement in understanding of cancer biology and CTCs role in cancer metastasis. == Mechanism == Traditionally, it was believed that CTC clusters needed to dissociate into individual cells during their journey through the bloodstream to seed secondary tumors. However, recent studies show that CTC clusters can travel through the bloodstream intact, enabling them to perform every step of metastasis while maintaining their group/cluster structure. The cancer exodus hypothesis asserts that CTC clusters have several distinct advantages that increase their metastatic potential: Higher metastatic efficiency: CTC clusters have been shown to possess superior seeding capabilities at distant sites compared to single CTCs. Survival and proliferation: The collective nature of CTC clusters allows them to share resources and offer intercellular support, improving their overall survival rates in the bloodstream.", "The cancer exodus hypothesis asserts that CTC clusters have several distinct advantages that increase their metastatic potential: Higher metastatic efficiency: CTC clusters have been shown to possess superior seeding capabilities at distant sites compared to single CTCs. Survival and proliferation: The collective nature of CTC clusters allows them to share resources and offer intercellular support, improving their overall survival rates in the bloodstream. Resistance to treatment: CTC clusters exhibit unique gene expression profiles that contribute to their ability to evade certain cancer therapies, making them more resistant than individual tumor cells. == Clinical relevance == The cancer exodus hypothesis offers important insights into how metastasis occurs and highlights the significance of CTC clusters in cancer progression. Detecting and analyzing CTC clusters through liquid biopsies could offer valuable information about the aggressiveness and metastatic potential of cancers. This information is particularly useful for identifying patients who may benefit from more aggressive treatment strategies. == Characterization == The hypothesis was developed due to several key studies, which have demonstrated the ability of CTC clusters to: Intravasate and travel as clusters: Research has shown that CTC clusters can enter the bloodstream as a group, travel through the circulatory system intact, and maintain their cluster phenotype during transit. Extravasate through angiopellosis: A key finding of the hypothesis is that CTC clusters do not need to disaggregate to exit the bloodstream.", "== Characterization == The hypothesis was developed due to several key studies, which have demonstrated the ability of CTC clusters to: Intravasate and travel as clusters: Research has shown that CTC clusters can enter the bloodstream as a group, travel through the circulatory system intact, and maintain their cluster phenotype during transit. Extravasate through angiopellosis: A key finding of the hypothesis is that CTC clusters do not need to disaggregate to exit the bloodstream. Instead, they can undergo a process called angiopellosis, in which entire clusters migrate out of the blood vessels as a group, retaining their multicellular form. These findings underscore the critical role of CTC clusters in driving the metastatic cascade and suggest that CTC clusters could serve as important biomarkers in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms that allow CTC clusters to retain their structure and survive in circulation opens new avenues for targeted cancer therapies designed to disrupt this process. == Future directions == As research into the cancer exodus hypothesis progresses, new therapeutic strategies could emerge to specifically target CTC clusters. Blocking their formation, disrupting their cohesion, or preventing their ability to survive in the bloodstream could offer new ways to prevent metastasis in aggressive cancers. Continued studies will be essential to further elucidate the biological pathways involved in CTC cluster-mediated metastasis and develop potential treatment interventions.", "Blocking their formation, disrupting their cohesion, or preventing their ability to survive in the bloodstream could offer new ways to prevent metastasis in aggressive cancers.

In the twentieth century, these exchanges were variously articulated in analytical psychology (including Jung\u2019s alchemical hermeneutics), humanistic workshop cultures and the human potential movement, transpersonal psychology, and symbolic counselling that repurposed oracular media (e.g., tarot, astrology, or the I Ching). Rather than a single genealogy, historians emphasise plural processes of transmission, translation, and hybridisation across specific networks and publics\u2014among them Theosophy (with codified chakras and subtle bodies), Anthroposophy (linking esoteric doctrines to pedagogical and para-clinical projects), the Eranos circle (mediating Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions), and late-modern markets often labelled \u201cNew Age\u201d.

Historians read these idioms as part of a broader late-modern psychologization of religious repertoires that facilitated their translation into popular psychological frames. One of the main intellectual bridges of mind-cure/New Thought with earlier esotericisms and scholar philosophy of mind was the swedenborgian minister Warren Felt Evans, who articulated a doctrine of \u201cmental therapeutics\u201d by combining mesmeric suggestion with Emanuel Swedenborg\u2019s mysticism, the American mind-cure tradition, and the subjective idealism of George Berkeley. Alongside occultist codifications, late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century comparative religion and history of religions projects created interpretive frames for reading premodern symbol-systems (e.g., alchemical, visionary or divinatory corpora) in dialogue with emerging psychological languages. Philological and comparative syntheses furnished taxonomies and narratives that could later be reframed in counselling and self-work, a trajectory consolidated in the 1930s around forums integrating Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions approaches, including figures later associated with the Eranos circle such as Mircea Eliade and Henry Corbin.", "Alongside occultist codifications, late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century comparative religion and history of religions projects created interpretive frames for reading premodern symbol-systems (e.g., alchemical, visionary or divinatory corpora) in dialogue with emerging psychological languages.

Within twentieth-century ceremonial magic, Israel Regardie framed Golden Dawn techniques\u2014especially the \u201cMiddle Pillar\u201d\u2014as psychological procedures for enhancing or \u201cexalting\u201d consciousness, and published core ritual materials (1937\u201340), easing their circulation into occulture and self-work milieus. Historiographically, Regardie functions as a case for analysing distinct modes of \"psychologization of esotericism\" (e.g., terminological and complementary) and the appeal to a \u201cmagical plane\u201d that relocates efficacy claims to a psychic register compatible with depth-psychological idioms. Tradition interfaces in this period Theosophy codified subtle-body and chakra maps for Western publics, providing portable visual grammars subsequently re-described in psychological and wellness idioms. Anthroposophy linked esoteric doctrines to pedagogical and para-clinical projects (e.g., Eurythmy), where movement, colour and form were framed as instruments of development and regulation. A concurrent American strand, New Thought, articulated mental-causation vocabularies that later informed self-help and coaching; historians situate this diffusion within late-modern occulture and the psychologization of religion. Institutional and editorial hubs in this period The Theosophical Society and its publishing arms (e.g., Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar) disseminated handbooks and plates of subtle-body/chakra schemes for non-initiatory audiences, while anthroposophic centres around the Goetheanum (Dornach) developed pedagogical and para-clinical programmes that integrated symbolic movement and arts therapies.", "A concurrent American strand, New Thought, articulated mental-causation vocabularies that later informed self-help and coaching; historians situate this diffusion within late-modern occulture and the psychologization of religion.

Lecture circuits and comparative-religion forums linked erudite synthesis with psychological hermeneutics, helping to normalise interpretive (non-realist) uses of esoteric materials in counselling and education. === Twentieth century: analytical, humanistic and transpersonal === In the early to mid-twentieth century, approaches associated with Analytical psychology developed sustained hermeneutics of premodern symbol-systems\u2014most prominently Alchemy\u2014as resources for psychological theory and practice, with Active imagination and mandala work translating symbolic repertoires into models of psychic transformation and individuation. Comparative engagements (including dialogues around classical divination texts such as the I Ching) encouraged a broader reception of esoteric imagery in counselling milieus. Within this framework, Carl Jung\u2019s notion of synchronicity (\u201can acausal connecting principle\u201d) underwrote interpretive uses of divinatory media\u2014such as the I Ching\u2014in counselling settings, framing them as structured prompts for meaning-making rather than as vehicles of predictive knowledge. From the 1960s, humanistic workshop cultures and venues such as the Esalen Institute functioned as hubs for experiential methods that framed inner change in strongly symbolic terms. Within these circuits, oracular media and ritualised settings were re-described as vehicles for self-exploration and interpersonal learning, a move that normalised the assimilation of esoteric motifs into therapeutic language without requiring adherence to realist\u2013occult claims.", "From the 1960s, humanistic workshop cultures and venues such as the Esalen Institute functioned as hubs for experiential methods that framed inner change in strongly symbolic terms.

Transpersonal psychology systematised these developments by theorising non-ordinary states and by integrating selected esoteric vocabularies\u2014subtle-body maps, archetypal narratives, and ritualised techniques\u2014into psychological models of development, crisis and integration. Reviews in the field highlight both historical debts to Western esotericism and the need for careful source-tracing to distinguish symbolic/interpretive framings from realist assertions, and to separate genealogy from questions of efficacy. Tradition interfaces in this period Within Analytical psychology, Jungian hermeneutics re-read premodern symbol-systems (notably Alchemy) for psychological theory and practice, while Jungian and allied circles engaged divination corpora (e.g., the I Ching) as symbolic prompts in counselling.

In parallel, Fourth Way circles associated with G. I. Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky supplied movement and dramaturgic formats later adapted in self-development workshops.

Institutional and editorial hubs in this period The Eranos meetings (Ascona) interfaced Jungian circles with history-of-religions scholarship, stabilising psychological readings of premodern symbol-systems (including Asian corpora) in interpretive, non-realist frames. Mid-century workshop venues such as the Esalen Institute (Big Sur) structured experiential formats\u2014encounter, movement, guided imagination\u2014in which symbolic and ritual devices circulated alongside clinical and educational experimentation; associations and journals consolidated Transpersonal psychology as a field. At the boundary of psychology proper, parapsychology laboratories and surveys extended the nineteenth-century psychical-research agenda (e.g., studies of telepathy/clairvoyance) into experimental and questionnaire-based programmes. === Late 20th century to present: hybrids, wellness and coaching === From the late twentieth century, repertoires previously clustered in specialist milieus migrated into wider self-help, wellness and coaching cultures. Modern transpositions of yoga supplied somatic and attentional techniques that could be framed in secular or symbolic terms, sometimes retaining subtle-body vocabularies and sometimes recoded physiologically; posture-based systems and allied practices entered therapeutic and educational niches where they functioned as vehicles for self-regulation without requiring adherence to esoteric cosmologies. In counselling and workshop circuits, oracular media such as tarot, astrology and the I Ching were repurposed as projective tools within interpretive frames, foregrounding narrative construction and reflective dialogue rather than divinatory truth-claims. Parallel developments recoded esoteric diagrammatics (e.g., Kabbalah\u2019s Tree of Life) as grammars of self-work for lay audiences, often distributed through publishing, courses and retreat formats.", "In counselling and workshop circuits, oracular media such as tarot, astrology and the I Ching were repurposed as projective tools within interpretive frames, foregrounding narrative construction and reflective dialogue rather than divinatory truth-claims. Parallel developments recoded esoteric diagrammatics (e.g., Kabbalah\u2019s Tree of Life) as grammars of self-work for lay audiences, often distributed through publishing, courses and retreat formats. Sociological accounts describe these circulations through late-modern occulture and workshop economies that sit largely outside academic psychology but help explain the cultural vigency of hybrid vocabularies of \u201cenergy\u201d, archetypes and transformation. Tradition interfaces in this period Within the post-1960s expansion of experiential psychologies, the Gestalt movement (Fritz and Laura Perls; Paul Goodman) became a principal model at Esalen and allied centres. Although not an esoteric tradition, historians note that its here-and-now expressiveness and holistic awareness coexisted with\u2014and helped normalise\u2014a milieu in which esoteric repertoires were reframed in psychological terms, characteristic of the broader human potential and transpersonal currents. Modern yoga supplied body\u2013attention techniques translated into secular or symbolic-psychological idioms in wellness and para-clinical niches. Oracular media (tarot, astrology, I Ching) were redeployed as projective devices in symbolic counselling, while psychological receptions of astrology articulated a counselling idiom distinct from divinatory epistemologies.

Institutional and editorial hubs in this period Degree and certificate programmes under \u201ccontemplative\u201d or \u201cintegrative\u201d banners\u2014such as those at Naropa University and the California Institute of Integral Studies\u2014institutionalised translations of Asian and esoteric repertoires into educational and para-clinical formats alongside humanistic and transpersonal frameworks. Retreat centres and training networks scaled delivery through workshops and certifications, while publishing series oriented to spirituality\u2013psychology and practical symbolism supported diffusion into counselling, education and coaching. Historians analyse these developments under late-modern occulture and market logics rather than as extensions of academic psychology proper. ==== New religious movements and diffusion ==== Scholars of new religious movements (NRMs) have noted that several conduits linking esoteric repertoires to popular psychological culture ran through movement contexts\u2014e.g., Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Spiritism and, in late modernity, the heterogeneous networks often labelled \u201cNew Age\u201d (a label related with the esoteric belief in an astrological Age of Aquarius, although not every idea or movement labeled as New Age actually holds this belief). Rather than a single denomination, the New Age milieu functioned as a loose market of workshops, retreats and publishing that recycled and recombined esoteric materials with psychologized self-cultivation and therapeutic language. Sociological models describe this circulation in terms of a \u201ccultic milieu\u201d, in which heterodox ideas\u2014astrology, subtle-body schemes, trance techniques\u2014persist and periodically reappear in new guises; Partridge\u2019s notion of \u201cocculture\u201d further captures how such repertoires permeate popular culture beyond formal religion.", "Rather than a single denomination, the New Age milieu functioned as a loose market of workshops, retreats and publishing that recycled and recombined esoteric materials with psychologized self-cultivation and therapeutic language.

In this environment, esoteric content was often translated into symbolic-psychological frames (e.g., projective counselling, human potential workshops) or packaged for wellness and coaching, while academic psychology largely followed separate methodological trajectories. Although the New Age as a self-identified movement declined as an organizational label before the end of the 20th century, scholars argue that many of its psychologized practices and narratives dispersed into broader wellness, self-help, and 'spiritual but not religious' cultures where they continue to provide idioms for meaning-making and self-work. == Schools and modalities in psychology, psychotherapy, and counselling == === Analytical psychology (Jung) === Within analytical psychology, Carl Jung developed a sustained hermeneutics of premodern symbol-systems\u2014most prominently alchemy\u2014as resources for theorising psychic structure, transformation and individuation. Techniques such as active imagination, dream work and the use of mandalas exemplified a translation of esoteric repertoires into psychological practice under a symbolic/interpretive framing. Comparative engagements in Jungian circles, including dialogues around classical divination corpora (notably the I Ching), normalised the use of oracular media as projective prompts in counselling and self-exploration. In this milieu, the notion of synchronicity (\u201can acausal connecting principle\u201d) offered an interpretive rationale for treating draws and charts as meaningful coincidences to be worked hermeneutically rather than as divinatory proofs.", "Purely devotional mysticism (union without operative correspondences) is distinguished from esotericism; by contrast, secular mind\u2013body programmes without esoteric genealogy (e.g., standardized MBSR) are treated as contrasts rather than instances. === Methodological cautions === Consistent with the academic study of Western esotericism, the article distinguishes actors\u2019 emic self-descriptions from scholarly etic analysis. To avoid false positives, resemblance alone does not warrant claims of influence: at least one of the following is required\u2014(a) explicit self-attribution by the actors, (b) operational adoption of symbols/diagrams/rites as method, or (c) a traceable chain of transmission (people, texts, institutions) consistent with Faivre\u2019s components. In addition, the article separates realist\u2013occult claims from a symbolic/interpretive framing\u2014sometimes glossed informally, once here, as \u201cas-if real\u201d\u2014in which images, diagrams, rites or oracles function as structured prompts for meaning-making rather than as vehicles of literal knowledge. === Analytical framework used in this article === For descriptive clarity, each case is characterised along four axes: (1) episteme (realist\u2013occult; symbolic/interpretive; secular\u2013therapeutic), (2) frame (ritual/doctrinal or clinical/educational), (3) purpose (gnosis/unio; psychic integration; symptom relief; optimization), and (4) device (symbolic tools such as tarot, astrology or I Ching; trance/hypnosis/breathwork; somatic work; ritual/drama; textual formulas). Statements about efficacy are reported separately using broad bands (A = controlled trials or systematic reviews; B = observational or case-series evidence; C = testimonials or mixed/weak findings). These tags are heuristic and remain distinct from genealogical claims or value judgements. == Historiography and frameworks == Modern scholarship generally treats Faivre\u2019s componential definition as a heuristic grid rather than as an ontology for what esotericism \u201cis\u201d.", "Comparative engagements in Jungian circles, including dialogues around classical divination corpora (notably the I Ching), normalised the use of oracular media as projective prompts in counselling and self-exploration. In this milieu, the notion of synchronicity (\u201can acausal connecting principle\u201d) offered an interpretive rationale for treating draws and charts as meaningful coincidences to be worked hermeneutically rather than as divinatory proofs. Subsequent developments associated with archetypal psychology started by James Hillman emphasised imaginal and mythopoetic registers for clinical reflection, extending the Jungian repertoire of symbols and narratives while maintaining an interpretive (non-realist) stance toward premodern materials. In the broader history of ideas, historians treat these currents as instances of the \u201cpsychologization of religion\u201d and \u201csacralization of psychology\u201d in the twentieth century. === Psychosynthesis === Founded by Roberto Assagioli, psychosynthesis articulated a developmental model integrating will, imagination and symbolic techniques (guided imagery, reflective exercises), framed for psychotherapy and education. While drawing selectively on religious and esoteric vocabularies (e.g., stages, higher/unifying self), psychosynthesis presented these as symbolic devices for integration and meaning-making rather than as doctrinal commitments, and established dedicated training and counselling contexts distinct from Jungian institutions. In workshop and clinical formats, psychosynthesis employed structured sequences (evocation of imagery, reflective processing, value clarification) that align with humanistic and transpersonal milieus in which ritualised settings and symbolic repertoires were redeployed for experiential learning. Reviews at the psychology\u2013religion interface underline the need to separate genealogical description from empirical appraisal and to keep realist\u2013occult claims distinct from interpretive, \u201cas-if real\u201d framings.", "In workshop and clinical formats, psychosynthesis employed structured sequences (evocation of imagery, reflective processing, value clarification) that align with humanistic and transpersonal milieus in which ritualised settings and symbolic repertoires were redeployed for experiential learning.

Although Reich presented his model as biophysics rather than spirituality, his concept of orgone\u2014a universal life energy said to permeate both psyche and cosmos\u2014echoed older vitalist and mesmerist cosmologies. Scholars such as Christopher Partridge and Egil Asprem interpret Reich\u2019s system as part of the modern afterlife of esoteric vitalism, where notions of subtle energy were reformulated within psychological and quasi-scientific vocabularies. In historiographical perspective, Wouter J. Hanegraaff classifies this type of \u201cbiophysical occultism\u201d under the rubric of \u201crejected knowledge\u201d: claims framed as science but conceptually aligned with esoteric models of energy and self-transformation. In the postwar period, \u201cneo-Reichian\u201d movements extended these ideas into expressive and group-based psychotherapies that combined breathing, grounding, and cathartic movement.", "Hanegraaff classifies this type of \u201cbiophysical occultism\u201d under the rubric of \u201crejected knowledge\u201d: claims framed as science but conceptually aligned with esoteric models of energy and self-transformation. In the postwar period, \u201cneo-Reichian\u201d movements extended these ideas into expressive and group-based psychotherapies that combined breathing, grounding, and cathartic movement. Among them, Alexander Lowen\u2019s bioenergetic analysis, and related body-oriented approaches within the human potential movement integrated performative and affective techniques while recasting them in psychodynamic and secular terms. These modalities demonstrate how vitalist and paraphysical conceptions of body\u2013mind energy migrated from Western esotericism into somatic and transpersonal psychology, bridging the genealogies of dynamic psychiatry and the modern culture of self-regulation. === Transpersonal psychology === Transpersonal psychology systematised mid-twentieth-century developments by theorising non-ordinary states and integrating selected esoteric vocabularies\u2014subtle-body maps, archetypal narratives and ritualised techniques\u2014into psychological models of development, crisis and integration. In practice and training milieus influenced by the Human Potential Movement and venues such as the Esalen Institute, experiential formats (e.g., guided imagery, breathwork, ritualised settings) supplied containers within which symbolic repertoires could be framed for self-exploration and clinical reflection. Within the field\u2019s literature, commentators emphasise both genealogical debts to Western esotericism (e.g., Jungian hermeneutics, occultist codifications of subtle bodies) and the need for source-critical distinctions between symbolic/interpretive framings and realist\u2013occult claims. Reviews at the psychology\u2013religion interface also recommend keeping genealogical description analytically separate from empirical appraisal of outcomes in clinical or para-clinical contexts.", "Within the field\u2019s literature, commentators emphasise both genealogical debts to Western esotericism (e.g., Jungian hermeneutics, occultist codifications of subtle bodies) and the need for source-critical distinctions between symbolic/interpretive framings and realist\u2013occult claims. Reviews at the psychology\u2013religion interface also recommend keeping genealogical description analytically separate from empirical appraisal of outcomes in clinical or para-clinical contexts. In boundary zones adjacent to transpersonal studies, parapsychology continued the nineteenth-century psychical-research agenda in laboratory and survey settings (e.g., studies of telepathy or clairvoyance); in this article such intersections are treated as historical interfaces with psychology rather than as evidential endorsements. In this milieu, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and adjacent \u201cpsychonautics\u201d\u2014most prominently in the early work of Stanislav Grof (e.g., LSD psychotherapy and later holotropic breathwork)\u2014were framed as laboratories for mapping non-ordinary states with archetypal and symbolic vocabularies. Such programmes illustrate the field\u2019s dual emphasis on experiential method and interpretive framing, while reviews at the psychology\u2013religion interface caution to separate genealogical links to esoteric repertoires from evidential claims and to distinguish clinical protocols from neoshamanic or ritual translations. === Anthroposophic clinical and pedagogical therapies === In Anthroposophy, esoteric doctrines were extended into pedagogy and para-clinical practice, associating imagination and development with disciplined movement, colour and form. Under banners such as Eurythmy and arts-based therapeutic work, anthroposophic centres and clinics\u2014organised around hubs like the Goetheanum\u2014framed symbolic movement and creative exercises as instruments for well-being, rehabilitation or education, sometimes alongside subtle-body explanations and sometimes within secular pedagogical vocabularies. These programmes illustrate a pathway by which modern occultist repertoires entered educational and therapeutic niches: ritualised movement, diagrammatic grammars and guided imagination were re-coded as techniques for development and regulation in schoolrooms, clinics and workshops.", "Under banners such as Eurythmy and arts-based therapeutic work, anthroposophic centres and clinics\u2014organised around hubs like the Goetheanum\u2014framed symbolic movement and creative exercises as instruments for well-being, rehabilitation or education, sometimes alongside subtle-body explanations and sometimes within secular pedagogical vocabularies. These programmes illustrate a pathway by which modern occultist repertoires entered educational and therapeutic niches: ritualised movement, diagrammatic grammars and guided imagination were re-coded as techniques for development and regulation in schoolrooms, clinics and workshops. Historians treat the linkage between doctrine, pedagogy and para-clinical arts as a key channel of diffusion from esoteric milieus to psychological language, while maintaining a clear analytic separation between provenance and empirical claims about efficacy or safety. === Hypnosis and brief therapies === From nineteenth-century mesmerism and guided somnambulism to medical hypnosis and later brief, strategic or indirect approaches, trance work provides a through-line connecting esoteric repertoires and psychological technique. What began as claims about invisible \u201cfluids\u201d and mediumistic channels was re-coded in medical and psychological vocabularies as suggestion, attentional focusing and communicative framing; staged demonstrations and clinical case series helped normalise descriptive languages for trance phenomena and dissociation. In contemporary practice, indirect and narrative methods (often associated with Ericksonian influence) treat images, metaphors and ritualised sequences as devices for re-patterning experience without realist\u2013occult commitments. === Neoshamanisms and related practices === Late twentieth-century neoshamanic currents adapted drumming, \u201cjourneying\u201d and small-scale ritual dramaturgy into workshop formats oriented toward self-knowledge, counselling or group learning. In many cases\u2014e.g., the approach popularised by Michael Harner\u2014realist\u2013occult claims were downplayed in favour of symbolic or psychagogic framings, yet the borrowing of esoteric vocabularies and techniques remained evident.", "=== Neoshamanisms and related practices === Late twentieth-century neoshamanic currents adapted drumming, \u201cjourneying\u201d and small-scale ritual dramaturgy into workshop formats oriented toward self-knowledge, counselling or group learning.

These translations illustrate how ritual devices (rhythm, guided imagination, role-work, structured closure) can migrate into psychological idioms while cosmological truth-claims are bracketed. === Communication-based approaches (NLP and related packages) === Communication-centred trainings\u2014often grouped under NLP and allied packages\u2014combined elements from humanistic psychotherapy, Ericksonian communication and popular linguistics to offer pragmatic toolkits for persuasion, reframing and self-change. While not esoteric in doctrine, these programmes circulated in the same workshop economies as symbolic counselling and energy-themed practices, and at times repackaged esoteric maps in personal optimisation language (archetypes, \u201cenergy\u201d, transformation). Scholarly treatments emphasise the distinction between genealogical proximity to esoteric repertoires and empirical evaluation of outcomes, urging clear separation between provenance and evidential claims. === Parapsychology (boundary-field interface) === Nineteenth-century psychical research evolved into twentieth-century parapsychology, which pursued experimental and survey studies of anomalous cognition (e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance) at the boundary of psychology proper. In this article parapsychology is treated as a historical interface with psychology\u2014linked to case-genres on automatism and dissociation and intersecting selectively with transpersonal psychology debates on non-ordinary states\u2014rather than as a psychological school; genealogical description is kept distinct from evidential claims.", "=== Parapsychology (boundary-field interface) === Nineteenth-century psychical research evolved into twentieth-century parapsychology, which pursued experimental and survey studies of anomalous cognition (e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance) at the boundary of psychology proper.

An American strand often labelled New Thought\u2014later echoed in formulations such as the law of attraction\u2014provided vocabularies of mental causation and affirmation that were readily repackaged as techniques for self-knowledge, motivation and optimisation. Historians read these idioms within the broader late-modern dynamics of occulture and the cultic milieu, which situate diffusion through publishing, workshops, retreats and media rather than through academic psychology. Early twentieth-century popular psychology also popularised relaxation-through-attention methods. Writers such as Annie Payson Call taught guided relaxation and posture\u2013breath discipline for \u201cnerves\u201d and self-regulation in non-clinical settings, combining moral reform with bodily awareness (see relaxation techniques, guided imagery). Her work, including Power Through Repose (1891), translated the harmonial and mind-cure milieux\u2014shaped in part by Swedenborgianism, mesmerism and American metaphysical religion\u2014into a psychophysical programme of self-culture.", "Writers such as Annie Payson Call taught guided relaxation and posture\u2013breath discipline for \u201cnerves\u201d and self-regulation in non-clinical settings, combining moral reform with bodily awareness (see relaxation techniques, guided imagery). Her work, including Power Through Repose (1891), translated the harmonial and mind-cure milieux\u2014shaped in part by Swedenborgianism, mesmerism and American metaphysical religion\u2014into a psychophysical programme of self-culture. Historian Mark Singleton characterises her method (analytically) as \u201csalvation through relaxation\u201d, and argues that its emphasis on proprioceptive awareness and repose prefigured twentieth-century relaxation therapies and fed into Western receptions of \u201cyoga-like\u201d breath and relaxation practices. In this sense, Call exemplifies how harmonial religion prefigured the modern psychologization of esoteric ideas about inner harmony and divine influx. Historians also note that the \u201cbreath culture\u201d repertoire systematized by William Walker Atkinson (as \u201cYogi Ramacharaka\u201d) drew largely on Western hygienic and psychological currents subsequently reframed in Indic vocabulary; scholarship interprets this as a case of Western re-signification rather than direct transmission from South Asian sources. In parallel, the Mazdaznan movement propagated a \u201creligion of breathing\u201d that blended Theosophical, neo-Zoroastrian and popular psychophysiological motifs, illustrating early esoteric reinterpretations of respiratory discipline within the American harmonial field. Among late-1960s self-help and human potential offerings, Jos\u00e9 Silva\u2019s Silva Method (originally \u201cSilva Mind Control\u201d) packaged relaxation/auto-hypnosis and guided imagery\u2014 including exercises with \u201cinner guides\u201d (imaginal counselors)\u2014together with the era\u2019s alpha-training discourse and New Thought-style autosuggestion, while also invoking elements of ESP in a parapsychological key. Reference works place the program in the self-religion/auto-help milieu rather than clinical psychotherapy and note Silva\u2019s autodidactic background (psychology, yoga, modern Rosicrucian doctrines) and the model\u2019s international diffusion via seminars and books.", "Among late-1960s self-help and human potential offerings, Jos\u00e9 Silva\u2019s Silva Method (originally \u201cSilva Mind Control\u201d) packaged relaxation/auto-hypnosis and guided imagery\u2014 including exercises with \u201cinner guides\u201d (imaginal counselors)\u2014together with the era\u2019s alpha-training discourse and New Thought-style autosuggestion, while also invoking elements of ESP in a parapsychological key.

A second conduit was personality typing. The Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), inspired by Jungian typology, achieved wide uptake in education, management and pastoral guidance despite sustained methodological criticism concerning reliability, temporal stability of \u201ctypes\u201d and predictive validity; overviews recommend caution regarding its use for selection or diagnosis. By contrast, the modern Enneagram took shape in late twentieth-century esoteric\u2013therapeutic milieus (e.g., Oscar Ichazo's system and later adaptations by Claudio Naranjo), before diffusing into counselling and coaching; academic surveys emphasise its recent genealogy, heterogeneous evidence base and cultural vigency rather than established efficacy. Communication-focused packages\u2014commonly grouped under NLP\u2014combined elements from humanistic psychotherapy, Ericksonian communication and popular linguistics to offer toolkits for persuasion, reframing and self-change. While not esoteric in doctrine, such programmes circulated in the same workshop economies as symbolic counselling and energy-themed practices, and at times repackaged esoteric maps (archetypes, \u201cenergy\u201d, transformation) in optimisation language. Systematic reviews report insufficient evidence for robust effects and note pervasive methodological limitations.", "While not esoteric in doctrine, such programmes circulated in the same workshop economies as symbolic counselling and energy-themed practices, and at times repackaged esoteric maps (archetypes, \u201cenergy\u201d, transformation) in optimisation language. Systematic reviews report insufficient evidence for robust effects and note pervasive methodological limitations. Educational and pastoral counselling contexts also served as diffusion channels: personality typologies (MBTI; the modern Enneagram) and symbolic counselling devices were adopted for guidance and self-exploration, often framed under values education or spiritual accompaniment. Within this translation, symbolic/interpretive uses were normalised over realist\u2013occult claims. At the edges of popular psychology, ritualised or dramaturgic formats were marketed for personal change. The term \u201cpsychomagic\u201d has been used for symbolic\u2013ritual interventions in advice literature and workshops, with genealogical ties to esoteric repertoires and mythopoetic narratives; scholarly treatments read these as cultural phenomena within contemporary occulture rather than as established clinical modalities. Likewise, family constellations circulate in coaching and group-work settings with strong dramaturgic elements; reviews highlight mixed evidence and methodological concerns, advising caution and clear framing when used in para-clinical contexts. Some masculinity coaching and men\u2019s-group ecologies drew selectively on Jungian archetypal vocabularies and, in some milieus, on neo-tantric, neidan, or polarity of \u201cenergy\u201d (Sulphur or Sun-masculine/Mercury or Moon-femenine from alchemy, Shiva/Shakti, yin and yang) rhetorics, illustrating how symbolic repertoires are operationalised in advice genres outside formal clinical frameworks.", "These tags are heuristic and remain distinct from genealogical claims or value judgements. == Historiography and frameworks == Modern scholarship generally treats Faivre\u2019s componential definition as a heuristic grid rather than as an ontology for what esotericism \u201cis\u201d. In this perspective, the grid helps historians describe how symbolic mediations and techniques of transformation were translated into psychological idioms in specific periods and publics, while avoiding essentialist claims. Placed within nineteenth- and twentieth-century contexts, Wouter J. Hanegraaff proposes an etic use of \u201coccultism\u201d for modern currents that explored interfaces between science, comparative religion and esoteric practice, and describes a two-way traffic between religious and psychological languages\u2014\u201cpsychologization of religion\u201d and \u201csacralization of psychology\u201d\u2014to account for the reception of alchemy, astrology and subtle-body maps in theory, therapy and self-work. For diffusion beyond academic or ecclesiastical institutions, historians of contemporary religion draw on sociological models. The notion of the cultic milieu proposed by Colin Campbell designates an environment in which heterodox repertoires (e.g., astrology, trance, subtle bodies) persist, recirculate and recombine; Christopher Partridge\u2019s \u201cocculture\u201d points to a cultural reservoir mediated by publishing, media and popular culture, through which psychologised self-work, workshops and wellness/coaching markets became prominent vectors of reception. Within this historiographic framing, hubs such as the Eranos meetings in Switzerland functioned as interfaces between Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions approaches, helping to normalise psychological readings of premodern symbol-systems (including Asian repertoires) in interpretive, non-realist terms.", "Likewise, family constellations circulate in coaching and group-work settings with strong dramaturgic elements; reviews highlight mixed evidence and methodological concerns, advising caution and clear framing when used in para-clinical contexts.

Across these formats, the article maintains an analytic distinction between provenance (genealogical links to esoteric repertoires) and evidence (empirical appraisal of outcomes). Symbolic/interpretive framings\u2014sometimes glossed as \u201cas-if real\u201d\u2014are reported with attribution and kept distinct from realist\u2013occult assertions; cultural visibility in wellness and coaching markets does not constitute clinical validation. Energy-labelled offerings (e.g., reiki-style sessions in coaching or as complementary add-ons) likewise illustrate how subtle-body vocabularies circulate in para-clinical niches; historians frame these under occulture/market diffusion rather than academic psychology. == Esoteric-linked mental health hospitals == In Brazil, Kardecist spiritism (a French origins branch of Spiritualism) developed durable interfaces with mental-health provision through Spiritist psychiatric hospitals that combine conventional psychiatric care with complementary Spiritist practices (e.g., \u201cpasses\u201d, mediumistic counselling). Historical and clinical overviews document this model as emerging in the early\u2013mid twentieth century and concentrated in Brazil; surveys describe operating structures, staffing and modalities of care across leading centres. In this article such institutions are treated as regional institutionalizations of an esoteric repertoire within modern healthcare systems; genealogical description is kept distinct from evidential claims about clinical outcomes.", "Historical and clinical overviews document this model as emerging in the early\u2013mid twentieth century and concentrated in Brazil; surveys describe operating structures, staffing and modalities of care across leading centres. In this article such institutions are treated as regional institutionalizations of an esoteric repertoire within modern healthcare systems; genealogical description is kept distinct from evidential claims about clinical outcomes. A different pathway of institutionalization appears in anthroposophic hospitals in Germany to Anthroposophy\u2014where integrative frameworks include psychiatry/psychosomatics alongside arts-based and movement therapies (e.g., Eurythmy). Reviews of anthroposophic medicine situate these hospitals within an integrative multimodal system, while institutional profiles list dedicated departments (e.g., Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Herdecke). As elsewhere in the article, institutional presence is reported separately from clinical validation, and interpretive/symbolic framings are distinguished from realist\u2013occult claims. == Comparative techniques and devices == This section surveys devices that operate across otherwise distinct schools\u2014symbolic tools, altered-state protocols, ritual/dramatic/artistic expression formats, body\u2013attention practices, and sound-based procedures\u2014and documents how they were translated into psychological frames (interpretive, non-realist) and adopted in clinical, para-clinical and coaching settings without necessitating doctrinal buy-in from their esoteric or religious sources. Provenance (channels of transmission) is kept analytically distinct from evidential claims, with outcomes often interpreted through common factors and meaning responses in structured settings. === Symbol work === Symbol-oriented work includes the redeployment of oracular media\u2014e.g., tarot, astrology and the I Ching\u2014as projective prompts in counselling and self-exploration.", "Provenance (channels of transmission) is kept analytically distinct from evidential claims, with outcomes often interpreted through common factors and meaning responses in structured settings. === Symbol work === Symbol-oriented work includes the redeployment of oracular media\u2014e.g., tarot, astrology and the I Ching\u2014as projective prompts in counselling and self-exploration. In Jungian and humanistic milieus, practice centres on image, narrative construction and reflective dialogue rather than on divinatory epistemologies; references to synchronicity provided an interpretive rationale for treating draws, charts and hexagrams as meaningful coincidences to be worked hermeneutically, not as predictive proofs. In educational and pastoral contexts, symbolic devices have similarly been used for guidance and values-clarification, further decoupling symbolic efficacy from realist\u2013occult claims. === Trance, breathing and psychedelics === Although often framed in physiological or psychological terms, relaxation, guided imagery, and breath-culture systems developed within harmonial and New Thought milieus (see also Body and attention for later somatic adaptations) functioned as practical psychologizations (popular psychology) of esoteric ideas\u2014linking inner discipline, divine influx, and mental causation. Scholars of Western esotericism interpret these as early instances of \u201cpsychologized esotericism\u201d preceding formal schools of psychotherapy. Beyond explicitly mystical or trance-based techniques, late nineteenth-century harmonial and New Thought movements developed gentler forms of psychophysical practice\u2014relaxation, guided imagery, and breath-culture systems\u2014that aimed at balancing mind and body without inducing altered states. Decades later, in transpersonal milieus, there were developed altered state of consciousness techniques that range from clinical hypnosis and guided breathing to psychedelic-assisted sessions.", "Beyond explicitly mystical or trance-based techniques, late nineteenth-century harmonial and New Thought movements developed gentler forms of psychophysical practice\u2014relaxation, guided imagery, and breath-culture systems\u2014that aimed at balancing mind and body without inducing altered states. Decades later, in transpersonal milieus, there were developed altered state of consciousness techniques that range from clinical hypnosis and guided breathing to psychedelic-assisted sessions. Across otherwise divergent framings, practice typically combines induction (or pharmacological set/setting), focused attention and post-experience integration, with symbolic material (imagery, archetypal language, ritual scripts) recruited as aids to meaning-making and restructuring. Scholarship in transpersonal studies stresses separating genealogy from efficacy and distinguishing clinical protocols (screening, preparation, integration) from neoshamanic or workshop translations. A related practice are late\u2013twentieth-century \u201cactive/dynamic meditations\u201d that blend breathwork, rhythmic movement and brief catharsis with Eastern symbolic vocabularies (e.g. \"kundalini activation\" with neotantric or yogic language); in practice they circulated through humanistic and transpersonal workshop markets as psychologized self-regulation techniques. === Arts-based psychotherapies and counselling === ==== Ritual movement and dramatization ==== Ritualised and dramatic formats\u2014ranging from structured openings and closures to role-work, gesture, and symbolic sequencing\u2014translate esoteric dramaturgies into educational, humanistic, and para-clinical settings oriented toward self-insight and emotional regulation. In workshop and counselling circuits influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychology, the emphasis falls on containment, process, and symbolic rehearsal rather than on doctrinal belief, illustrating how ritual and theatrical devices were reframed as psychological techniques.", "=== Arts-based psychotherapies and counselling === ==== Ritual movement and dramatization ==== Ritualised and dramatic formats\u2014ranging from structured openings and closures to role-work, gesture, and symbolic sequencing\u2014translate esoteric dramaturgies into educational, humanistic, and para-clinical settings oriented toward self-insight and emotional regulation. In workshop and counselling circuits influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychology, the emphasis falls on containment, process, and symbolic rehearsal rather than on doctrinal belief, illustrating how ritual and theatrical devices were reframed as psychological techniques. Early twentieth-century reformers such as George Gurdjieff and Rudolf Steiner developed choreographed repertoires\u2014Gurdjieff\u2019s \"Movements\" and Steiner\u2019s Eurythmy\u2014that integrated posture, rhythm, and spatial design to enact metaphysical correspondences and cultivate heightened awareness. These practices functioned as embodied exercises of esoteric self-transformation, combining ritual, theatre, and psychophysical discipline. Later adaptations recontextualised their techniques for pedagogical and therapeutic use under symbolic (non-realist) descriptions, creating points of translation between spiritual choreography and psychological process work. From the mid-twentieth century onward, a constellation of expressive and creative psychotherapies\u2014such as psychodrama, dance/movement therapy, and related experiential group practices\u2014expanded this performative lineage. Drawing variously on Jungian symbolism, Reichian somatic therapy, and the holistic philosophy of humanistic and transpersonal psychology, their founders framed movement, voice, and enactment as means of catharsis, integration, and energetic balance. Although later professionalised in clinical and educational contexts, historians of psychology trace their conceptual origins to the spiritual humanism and vitalist cosmologies that characterised the broader Western esoteric revival.", "Drawing variously on Jungian symbolism, Reichian somatic therapy, and the holistic philosophy of humanistic and transpersonal psychology, their founders framed movement, voice, and enactment as means of catharsis, integration, and energetic balance. Although later professionalised in clinical and educational contexts, historians of psychology trace their conceptual origins to the spiritual humanism and vitalist cosmologies that characterised the broader Western esoteric revival. Within these hybrid workshop cultures, ritualised movement and dramatic role-play were interpreted through the languages of affect regulation, meaning-making, and embodied insight\u2014continuing the psychologisation of esoteric repertoires within the broader human potential and transpersonal milieu. In parallel, other twentieth-century movements systematised body-based psychotherapies into formal schools, bridging somatic, energetic, and expressive paradigms. ==== Visual and imaginal practices (colour/diagram work) ==== Beyond formal art therapies, workshop and counselling milieus influenced by Jungian and esoteric repertoires have redeployed imaginal and diagrammatic devices\u2014e.g., drawing or colouring mandalas; colour sequences mapped to subtle-body grammars; reflective composition around emblematic images\u2014as structured prompts for narrative, value-clarification and self-regulation. In these uses, premodern diagrams and colour codings function as symbolic scaffolds rather than doctrinal claims, illustrating how arts-based exercises circulate across clinical, para-clinical and coaching settings under interpretive (non-realist) frames. === Sound-based practices === Sound-focused sessions\u2014e.g., singing bowls and gong baths\u2014are often framed through Pythagorean and (neo)hermetic (The Kybalion) narratives of hidden vibration and cosmic harmony (a Western esoteric lineage) while being presented with Asian aesthetics or branding (\u201cTibetan bowls\u201d) in late-modern wellness markets. A parallel, secular rationale describes these formats as aids to relaxation, attentional focus and group containment.", "=== Sound-based practices === Sound-focused sessions\u2014e.g., singing bowls and gong baths\u2014are often framed through Pythagorean and (neo)hermetic (The Kybalion) narratives of hidden vibration and cosmic harmony (a Western esoteric lineage) while being presented with Asian aesthetics or branding (\u201cTibetan bowls\u201d) in late-modern wellness markets. A parallel, secular rationale describes these formats as aids to relaxation, attentional focus and group containment. In either case, practice emphasises patterned sound, pacing and bounded ritual to scaffold meaning-making and regulation, with symbolic/interpretive efficacy foregrounded over realist claims. === Body and attention === Somatic and attentional practices\u2014postures, movement sequences and contemplative exercises\u2014were adopted in modern transpositions of yoga, Buddhist sati, and related repertoires, sometimes retaining Theosophical subtle body vocabularies and sometimes reframed in secular or physiological terms. Historical studies trace how posture-based systems and allied techniques entered wellness and therapeutic niches (e.g. relaxation techniques), where they could function as vehicles for self-regulation without adherence to esoteric or religious cosmologies. Earlier Western harmonial and breath-culture traditions (see Popular psychology and coaching) already framed breathing and relaxation as psychophysical techniques linking mind\u2013body regulation and esoteric ideas of vital influx. === Energy-themed practices (subtle-body framings) === Under \u201cenergy\u201d labels (e.g., reiki, \u201chealing touch\u201d, pranic variants), late-modern counselling and coaching milieus sometimes redeploy subtle-body vocabularies from Western esoteric and hybrid Asian-Western repertoires.", "Earlier Western harmonial and breath-culture traditions (see Popular psychology and coaching) already framed breathing and relaxation as psychophysical techniques linking mind\u2013body regulation and esoteric ideas of vital influx. === Energy-themed practices (subtle-body framings) === Under \u201cenergy\u201d labels (e.g., reiki, \u201chealing touch\u201d, pranic variants), late-modern counselling and coaching milieus sometimes redeploy subtle-body vocabularies from Western esoteric and hybrid Asian-Western repertoires. In such settings, techniques are framed interpretively\u2014as symbolic scaffolds for attention, meaning-making and regulation\u2014or, in some complementary/alternative medicine contexts, as putative causal interventions. Scholarly accounts treat these as boundary phenomena of diffusion (occulture, workshop economies) and urge analytic separation between provenance (subtle-body genealogies) and evidential claims about outcomes. In practice these offerings often co-occur with body\u2013attention formats (e.g., yoga-based sessions); here they are treated separately because \u201cenergy\u201d labels involve subtle-body vocabularies and, in some contexts, putative causal claims that go beyond symbolic/physiological framings. === Past-life regressions and \u201cAkashic\u201d narrative work (boundary uses) === Some counselling and coaching niches redeploy theosophical vocabularies\u2014e.g., Akashic records channeling or use past life regressions and related narratives as frames for meaning-making and personal storytelling. In such settings, practitioners may bracket cosmological truth-claims and present sessions as symbolic prompts; in others, realist assertions are made. Historians treat these as cases of late-modern diffusion (occulture) of esoteric repertoires into self-work, while transpersonal commentators emphasise keeping genealogical description distinct from evidential claims and separating workshop formats from clinical protocols.", "In such settings, practitioners may bracket cosmological truth-claims and present sessions as symbolic prompts; in others, realist assertions are made. Historians treat these as cases of late-modern diffusion (occulture) of esoteric repertoires into self-work, while transpersonal commentators emphasise keeping genealogical description distinct from evidential claims and separating workshop formats from clinical protocols. === Cross-cutting uptake in clinical and coaching settings === Across these devices, adoption in psychotherapy, counselling and coaching often proceeds under interpretive (symbolic) framings that bracket cosmological truth-claims. Reported benefits\u2014when present\u2014are frequently interpreted in terms of common factors (working alliance, expectancy, meaning response) and the structuring of attention and emotion by bounded settings (ritual sequence, symbolic media, group containment). Cultural visibility in workshop and wellness markets is documented by sociological accounts of late-modern occulture and the cultic milieu, but such visibility is kept analytically distinct from clinical validation. == Evidence, risks, and debates == This article separates questions of provenance from questions of efficacy. Genealogical links to esoteric repertoires do not in themselves predict outcomes; conversely, cultural visibility in wellness or coaching markets does not constitute clinical validation. Reviews at the psychology\u2013religion interface therefore recommend keeping source-tracing distinct from empirical appraisal and maintaining clarity between symbolic/interpretive framings and realist\u2013occult assertions.", "Genealogical links to esoteric repertoires do not in themselves predict outcomes; conversely, cultural visibility in wellness or coaching markets does not constitute clinical validation.

Reported benefits\u2014when present\u2014are frequently interpreted in terms of common factors and meaning responses in structured settings (working alliance, expectancy, ritual sequence, symbolic media, group containment). In personality typing, the Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)\u2014inspired by Jungian typology\u2014has seen widespread uptake in education and management while attracting sustained criticism concerning reliability, temporal stability of \u201ctypes\u201d and predictive validity; overviews recommend caution regarding its use for selection or diagnosis. By contrast, the modern Enneagram emerged from late twentieth-century esoteric\u2013therapeutic milieus (e.g., \u00d3scar Ichazo; later adaptations by Claudio Naranjo) before diffusing into counselling and coaching; academic surveys emphasise its recent provenance, heterogeneous evidence base and cultural vigency rather than established efficacy. Communication-focused packages commonly grouped under NLP circulate in coaching and health-adjacent contexts; systematic reviews have reported insufficient evidence for robust effects and pervasive methodological limitations. Energy-labelled offerings (reiki-style sessions, \u201chealing touch\u201d, pranic variants) sit at the boundary of the field: critics question proposed subtle-energy mechanisms and call for higher-quality trials, while proponents and detractors dispute both mechanisms and effect sizes; the article therefore reports such practices as diffusion phenomena (occulture/workshop economies) and urges explicit separation between complementary uses and clinical claims. Boundary-field literatures such as parapsychology\u2014evolving from nineteenth-century psychical research into laboratory and survey programmes on anomalous cognition (e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance)\u2014are treated here as historical interfaces with psychology rather than as psychological schools; claims are reported with attribution and kept analytically distinct from genealogical description and from clinical efficacy appraisals.", "The notion of the cultic milieu proposed by Colin Campbell designates an environment in which heterodox repertoires (e.g., astrology, trance, subtle bodies) persist, recirculate and recombine; Christopher Partridge\u2019s \u201cocculture\u201d points to a cultural reservoir mediated by publishing, media and popular culture, through which psychologised self-work, workshops and wellness/coaching markets became prominent vectors of reception. Within this historiographic framing, hubs such as the Eranos meetings in Switzerland functioned as interfaces between Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions approaches, helping to normalise psychological readings of premodern symbol-systems (including Asian repertoires) in interpretive, non-realist terms. The article therefore combines componential description with diffusion models to track how esoteric repertoires travelled into psychological theory, clinical/para-clinical settings, and popular counselling cultures. Jung\u2019s theorisation of synchronicity is often cited as part of the modern \u201cpsychologization of religion\u201d, supplying a vocabulary by which divinatory repertoires could be recoded for counselling without realist\u2013occult commitments. === Rejected knowledge by academic psychology === In this line of analysis, Wouter J. Hanegraaff introduced the notion of rejected knowledge to describe bodies of thought and practice that once claimed rational or scientific legitimacy but were later excluded from academic discourse. The concept provides historians with a tool for understanding why movements such as mesmerism, psychical research, or vitalist biophysics\u2014though not self-identified as \u201cesoteric\u201d\u2014nonetheless display structural affinities with the esoteric field through their use of subtle-force cosmologies, analogical reasoning, and transformative techniques. === Psychologization of esotericism (historiographical models) === Scholarship has used \u201cpsychologization\u201d to describe how esoteric repertoires were reframed in psychological idioms or channelled through therapeutic formats.", "Energy-labelled offerings (reiki-style sessions, \u201chealing touch\u201d, pranic variants) sit at the boundary of the field: critics question proposed subtle-energy mechanisms and call for higher-quality trials, while proponents and detractors dispute both mechanisms and effect sizes; the article therefore reports such practices as diffusion phenomena (occulture/workshop economies) and urges explicit separation between complementary uses and clinical claims.

Likewise, narrative formats such as past-life or \u201cAkashic\u201d consultations are presented as boundary phenomena of diffusion; symbolic/interpretive framings are distinguished from realist claims. Safety and scope-of-practice concerns are most salient where non-ordinary states or strong catharsis are involved. Scholarly and clinical discussions converge on screening for vulnerability; clear preparation and integration phases; monitoring for dissociation or destabilisation; explicit consent about symbolic versus doctrinal framings; and robust referral pathways when indicated. In symbolic counselling and oracular work, ethical guidance stresses non-directive framing and avoidance of deterministic claims. More generally, hybrid settings benefit from transparent consent about interpretive status, clear separation between educational/experiential workshops and clinical treatment, and caution against conflating cultural vigency with evidential support. == See also == Western esotericism and science Western esotericism and the arts Analytical psychology Transpersonal psychology Cognitive science of religion Neuroscience of religion Scholarly approaches to mysticism == References == == Bibliography == Faivre, Antoine; Needleman, Jacob, eds.", "More generally, hybrid settings benefit from transparent consent about interpretive status, clear separation between educational/experiential workshops and clinical treatment, and caution against conflating cultural vigency with evidential support. == See also == Western esotericism and science Western esotericism and the arts Analytical psychology Transpersonal psychology Cognitive science of religion Neuroscience of religion Scholarly approaches to mysticism == References == == Bibliography == Faivre, Antoine; Needleman, Jacob, eds.

Wouter J. Hanegraaff proposed a bidirectional traffic\u2014\u201cpsychologization of religion\u201d and \u201csacralization of psychology\u201d\u2014as a lens for modern encounters between esotericism and psychology. Complementarily, long-duration histories of dynamic psychiatry (as theorized by the historiographer of psychiatry Henri Ellenberger) trace continuities from exorcism to mesmerism, hypnosis and the emergence of clinical psychologies, providing a background against which such reframings occurred. Recent work has refined \u201cpsychologization\u201d by distinguishing several modes (e.g., complementary, terminological, reductive, idealist) and by analysing the appeal to a distinct \u201cmagical plane\u201d (a separate-but-connected psychic locus) that insulates ritual practice from empirical critique while aligning it with psychoanalytic or depth-psychological vocabularies. These models help to map how actors translate ritual devices into symbolic or therapeutic procedures without presupposing realist\u2013occult claims.

Proto-psychologization in harmonial religion For clarity, modern scholarship distinguishes between actors\u2019 metaphysical vocabularies and historians\u2019 analytic categories. In this regard, the article follows the usage of harmonial religion (also called harmonialism) as a historiographical label (etic) designating a North American metaphysical ethos (19th\u201320th centuries) that links mind\u2013body\u2013spirit harmony to wellbeing, encompassing mind-cure/New Thought, breath culture and related esoteric milieux. The label harmonial religion\u2014part of what Catherine L. Albanese terms the broader American metaphysical religion\u2014was introduced in her study A Republic of Mind and Spirit (2007), while harmonialism is used by Anya P. Foxen to analyse Western reimaginings of yoga, respiration, and their orientalisation. Placed within the wider narrative of Western esotericism and psychology, what Albanese terms harmonial religion (and Foxen discusses as harmonialism)\u2014ranging from Swedenborgian metaphysics through mesmerism, mind-cure and breath culture\u2014constitutes a proto-psychological strand of modern esoteric thought.

These formations prefigure the twentieth-century \u201cpsychologization of religion\u201d analysed by Wouter J. Hanegraaff, wherein spiritual transformation and mental hygiene converge as parallel idioms of self-regulation and correspondence. == Periodisation of the intersection == === Enlightenment to nineteenth century === From late Enlightenment experiments in animal magnetism and guided \u201csomnambulism\u201d to fin-de-si\u00e8cle debates on suggestion and trance, early interfaces between esoteric repertoires and psychological inquiry unfolded across salons, clinics and s\u00e9ance rooms. Mesmeric practices circulated the idea of an invisible influence acting upon body and mind; controlled inductions and narrative management of altered states provided techniques and cases that would be reframed in medical and psychological vocabularies. During the early nineteenth century, the Transcendentalist movement in the United States\u2014particularly the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2014absorbed elements of Western esotericism, including Swedenborgian doctrines of correspondences\u2014which interpreted the visible world as an image of inner and spiritual processes\u2014and Neoplatonic conceptions of the \"Over-Soul\". Scholars of American religion such as Catherine L. Albanese interpret this Transcendentalist synthesis as part of the broader harmonial or metaphysical current that linked moral and mental harmony with spiritual vitality.", "Scholars of American religion such as Catherine L. Albanese interpret this Transcendentalist synthesis as part of the broader harmonial or metaphysical current that linked moral and mental harmony with spiritual vitality. This intellectual milieu provided a cultural background for later mind-cure and New Thought movements, in which esoteric motifs of correspondence and transformation were increasingly psychologized and reframed as methods of self-regulation and healing. Within the social worlds of spiritualism and early psychical research, clinicians and philosophers used trance cases to theorise divided consciousness. Pierre Janet\u2019s work on dissociation systematised observations of automatisms (automatic writing, trance speech) as expressions of partitioned awareness, while discussions by William James and Sigmund Freud\u2014both attentive to hypnosis and to hysteria debates\u2014helped normalise psychological framings that did not rely on occult fluids or literal spirit agencies. Case-rich monographs such as Th\u00e9odore Flournoy\u2019s study of glossolalia and secondary personalities supplied detailed documentation without doctrinal commitments, furnishing materials for theorising imagination, suggestion and divided consciousness in secular terms. By the century\u2019s end, comparative and indological presentations had begun to recast selected Asian repertoires in psychological or mentalist terms for Western audiences\u2014for example, Neo-Vedantic readings of Raja Yoga within modern interpretations of Yoga\u2014foreshadowing twentieth-century migrations of somatic\u2013attentional techniques into wellness and para-clinical niches. Tradition interfaces in this period Mesmerism and induced \u201csomnambulism\u201d popularised controlled trance and supplied early conduits from esoteric milieus to psychological technique (later recoded as hypnosis and suggestion).", "By the century\u2019s end, comparative and indological presentations had begun to recast selected Asian repertoires in psychological or mentalist terms for Western audiences\u2014for example, Neo-Vedantic readings of Raja Yoga within modern interpretations of Yoga\u2014foreshadowing twentieth-century migrations of somatic\u2013attentional techniques into wellness and para-clinical niches. Tradition interfaces in this period Mesmerism and induced \u201csomnambulism\u201d popularised controlled trance and supplied early conduits from esoteric milieus to psychological technique (later recoded as hypnosis and suggestion). spiritualism and early psychical research generated case-materials\u2014automatic writing, trance communication, secondary personalities\u2014that fed debates on imagination and dissociation; Flournoy\u2019s monograph is paradigmatic for this descriptive turn. Late-nineteenth-century indological receptions (e.g., Neo-Vedantic, mentalist readings of Raja Yoga) prefigured the twentieth-century translation of body\u2013attention repertoires into secular or symbolic frames. Institutional and editorial hubs in this period Venues ranged from salons to clinical theatres (e.g., the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re in Paris), while the Society for Psychical Research of London (SPR, 1882\u2013) professionalised report genres on automatisms and trance that fed psychological debates on imagination and dissociation. Book-length case studies\u2014such as Flournoy\u2019s\u2014circulated between s\u00e9ance rooms and clinics, helping to normalise descriptive vocabularies for trance phenomena without endorsing occult realism; sociological models later describe such circulations within a broader late-modern \u201ccultic milieu\u201d. === Occultism and comparative religion (late 19th\u2013early 20th centuries) === In the milieu of the Occult Revival of the 19th century in Western societies the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) became a key contact zone between s\u00e9ance cultures and emerging psychological inquiry.

The Septennial Act 1715 provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the Parliament Act 1911. Prior to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the prime minister's request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in 1974), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. 2001).

Because the government and prime minister are effectively indirectly elected through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a prime minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms. === House of Lords === Hereditary peers and life peers retain membership of the House of Lords for life, though members can resign or be expelled.

The term for state governors is four years in all states but Vermont and New Hampshire; the Vermont and New Hampshire governors serve for two years. The National Conference of State Legislatures reported in January 2007 that among state legislatures: 44 states had terms of office for the lower house of the state legislature (often termed the state House of Representatives) at two years.

Similarly, the lieutenant governors, who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial premier), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have commissioners, who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the governor-in-council (i.e.", "metadata": {"pageid": "10826158", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=10826158", "title": "Term of office", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "10826158_chunk_8", "chunk_id": 8, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 48, "end_sentence": 55, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\10826158.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "10826158_chunk_9", "text": "Similarly, the lieutenant governors, who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial premier), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention.

They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in by-elections during the middle of a Parliament. Under the Constitution Act, 1867, a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire.

Bittern can also be used as a source of magnesium ions (Mg2+) for the precipitation of struvite, a useful fertilizer, from wastewater containing nitrogen and phosphorus. One source of useful wastewater is landfill leachate. Bittern is just as good as other sources of magnesium ions at removing phosphorus from wastewater streams, but it lags behind other magnesium ion sources in terms of the removal of ammonia (a nitrogen compound). === Other uses === Bittern can be used to culture Haloquadratum archaea.

Descriptions of it and application of terminology to it, date back as early as ancient Greece in Plato's The Republic.

In Republic Book III, 415a\u2013417b, Plato (or Socrates within the dialogue) seeks not merely to justify the social hierarchy through the \"noble lie\", but also to devise a means of preventing intensified hostility between classes and harmoniously binding different strata together, by ensuring that each class exchanges its shares and roles and that these are distributed in a balanced way. In Plato\u2019s Republic, the \u201cgold of the soul\u201d does not refer to an actual metal, but rather to the nobility residing within the guardian\u2019s inner nature. By contrast, the \u201cgold of the earth\u201d signifies material wealth, portrayed as a source of envy, greed, intrigue, and corruption. Accordingly, he argues that the ruling and producing classes must possess different qualifications. The ruling class, endowed with the virtues likened to \u201cgold and silver\u201d in the soul, should therefore be excluded from the economic qualification to accumulate worldly wealth. The producing class, by contrast, possesses a temperament likened to \u201cbronze\u201d and thus may form and exchange wealth and property, but must be barred from participation in politics.", "metadata": {"pageid": "15754385", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15754385", "title": "Noble lie", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "15754385_chunk_1", "chunk_id": 1, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 6, "end_sentence": 13, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\15754385.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "15754385_chunk_2", "text": "The ruling class, endowed with the virtues likened to \u201cgold and silver\u201d in the soul, should therefore be excluded from the economic qualification to accumulate worldly wealth.

In his view, the ruling and producing classes should exchange the two types of qualifications\u2014political authority and economic power. Once these two domains are intermixed, the community\u2019s misfortune and injustice inevitably begin: But whenever they shall acquire for themselves land of their own and houses and coin, they will be house-holders and farmers instead of guardians, and will be transformed from the helpers of their fellow citizens to their enemies and masters, and so in hating and being hated, plotting and being plotted against they will pass their days fearing far more and rather the townsmen within than the foemen without \u2013 and then even then laying the course of near shipwreck for themselves and the state. Tarnopolsky argues that Plato\u2019s \"noble lie\" is not authoritarian propaganda but a self-conscious civic rhetorical device that tests and educates its audience by fostering critical suspicion toward founding myths. ==== Criticism ==== The concept of the noble lie as defined by Plato has sparked controversy among modern interpreters. Although some earlier classical scholars including Francis Cornford argued that \"noble lie\" was a mistranslation, Allan Bloom argued for a literal translation and interpretation of Plato's expression. In The Open Society and Its Enemies, Karl Popper remarks, \"It is hard to understand why those of Plato's commentators who praise him for fighting against the subversive conventionalism of the Sophists, and for establishing a spiritual naturalism ultimately based on religion, fail to censure him for making a convention, or rather an invention, the ultimate basis of religion.\" Religion for Plato is a noble lie, at least if we assume that Plato meant all of this sincerely, not cynically.", "metadata": {"pageid": "15754385", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15754385", "title": "Noble lie", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "15754385_chunk_2", "chunk_id": 2, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 12, "end_sentence": 19, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\15754385.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "15754385_chunk_3", "text": "Although some earlier classical scholars including Francis Cornford argued that \"noble lie\" was a mistranslation, Allan Bloom argued for a literal translation and interpretation of Plato's expression.

Popper finds Plato's conception of religion to have been very influential in subsequent thought. Leo Strauss noted that thinkers of the first rank, going back to Plato, had raised the problem of whether good and effective politicians could be completely truthful and still achieve the necessary ends of their society. In The City and Man, Strauss discusses the myths outlined in Plato's Republic that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it was likely acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than the accidents of birth. By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the polis. He questions whether myths are needed to give people meaning and purpose and whether they ensure a stable society in contrast to the more skeptical attitude which posits that men dedicated to the relentless examination of, in Nietzschean language, \"deadly truths\" can flourish freely, all the while concluding with an inquiry into whether there can be a limit to the political and epistemic absolutes.", "metadata": {"pageid": "15754385", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=15754385", "title": "Noble lie", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "15754385_chunk_3", "chunk_id": 3, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 18, "end_sentence": 25, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\15754385.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "15754385_chunk_4", "text": "By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the polis.

It showed that biological compounds could be synthesized with inorganic starting materials and weakened the previous notion of vitalism, or that a 'living' source was required to produce organic compounds. W\u00f6hler's work is often considered to be instrumental in the development of organic chemistry and natural product synthesis, both of which play a large part in modern chemical biology. Friedrich Miescher's work during the late 19th century investigating the cellular contents of human leukocytes led to the discovery of 'nuclein', which would later be renamed DNA. After isolating the nuclein from the nucleus of leukocytes through protease digestion, Miescher used chemical techniques such as elemental analysis and solubility tests to determine the composition of nuclein.

Phosphorylation events, either phosphorylation by protein kinases or dephosphorylation by phosphatases, result in protein activation or deactivation. These events have an impact on the regulation of physiological pathways, which makes the ability to dissect and study these pathways integral to understanding the details of cellular processes. There exist a number of challenges\u2014namely the sheer size of the phosphoproteome, the fleeting nature of phosphorylation events and related physical limitations of classical biological and biochemical techniques\u2014that have limited the advancement of knowledge in this area.

Although this approach, as well as related approaches, with slight modifications, has proven effective in a number of cases, these compounds lack adequate specificity for more general applications. Another class of compounds, mechanism-based inhibitors, combines knowledge of the kinase enzymology with previously utilized inhibition motifs.

Phosphorylation events have typically been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site (serine, threonine or tyrosine) to an amino acid, such as alanine, that cannot be phosphorylated. However, these techniques come with limitations and chemical biologists have developed improved ways of investigating protein phosphorylation. By installing phospho-serine, phospho-threonine or analogous phosphonate mimics into native proteins, researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often-unfavorable effects of mutations.

One of the best ways to detect conformational changes in proteins is to label the protein of interest with two fluorophores within close proximity. FRET will respond to internal conformational changes result from reorientation of one fluorophore with respect to the other. One can also use fluorescence to visualize enzyme activity, typically by using a quenched activity-based proteomics (qABP). Covalent binding of a qABP to the active site of the targeted enzyme will provide direct evidence concerning if the enzyme is responsible for the signal upon release of the quencher and regain of fluorescence. == Education in chemical biology == === Undergraduate education === Despite an increase in biological research within chemistry departments, attempts at integrating chemical biology into undergraduate curricula are lacking.

For example, cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars to probe their function. Carolyn Bertozzi's research group has developed methods for site-specifically reacting molecules at the surface of cells via synthetic sugars. === Combinatorial chemistry === Combinatorial chemistry involves simultaneously synthesizing a large number of related compounds for high-throughput analysis. Chemical biologists are able to use principles from combinatorial chemistry in synthesizing active drug compounds and maximizing screening efficiency. Similarly, these principles can be used in areas of agriculture and food research, specifically in the syntheses of unnatural products and in generating novel enzyme inhibitors. === Peptide synthesis === Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue-specific incorporation of \"posttranslational modifications\" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even ubiquitination. These properties are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post-translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins.", "metadata": {"pageid": "1686272", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1686272", "title": "Chemical biology", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "1686272_chunk_3", "chunk_id": 3, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 18, "end_sentence": 25, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\1686272.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "1686272_chunk_4", "text": "=== Peptide synthesis === Chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids as well as residue-specific incorporation of \"posttranslational modifications\" such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, and even ubiquitination. These properties are valuable for chemical biologists as non-natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins, while post-translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins. Although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends, the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein. To make protein-sized polypeptide chains with the small peptide fragments made by synthesis, chemical biologists can use the process of native chemical ligation. Native chemical ligation involves the coupling of a C-terminal thioester and an N-terminal cysteine residue, ultimately resulting in formation of a \"native\" amide bond. Other strategies that have been used for the ligation of peptide fragments using the acyl transfer chemistry first introduced with native chemical ligation include expressed protein ligation, sulfurization/desulfurization techniques, and use of removable thiol auxiliaries. === Enrichment techniques for proteomics === Chemical biologists work to improve proteomics through the development of enrichment strategies, chemical affinity tags, and new probes.

This involves targeting a peptide with a distinguishing feature like a biotin label or a post translational modification. Methods have been developed that include the use of antibodies, lectins to capture glycoproteins, and immobilized metal ions to capture phosphorylated peptides and enzyme substrates to capture select enzymes. === Enzyme probes === To investigate enzymatic activity as opposed to total protein, activity-based reagents have been developed to label the enzymatically active form of proteins (see Activity-based proteomics). For example, serine hydrolase- and cysteine protease-inhibitors have been converted to suicide inhibitors. This strategy enhances the ability to selectively analyze low abundance constituents through direct targeting.", "metadata": {"pageid": "1686272", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1686272", "title": "Chemical biology", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "1686272_chunk_5", "chunk_id": 5, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 30, "end_sentence": 37, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\1686272.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "1686272_chunk_6", "text": "For example, serine hydrolase- and cysteine protease-inhibitors have been converted to suicide inhibitors.

A method that has been developed uses \"analog-sensitive\" kinases to label substrates using an unnatural ATP analog, facilitating visualization and identification through a unique handle. === Employing biology === Many research programs are also focused on employing natural biomolecules to perform biological tasks or to support a new chemical method. In this regard, chemical biology researchers have shown that DNA can serve as a template for synthetic chemistry, self-assembling proteins can serve as a structural scaffold for new materials, and RNA can be evolved in vitro to produce new catalytic function.

Because our knowledge of the relationship between primary sequence, structure, and function of proteins is limited, rational design of new proteins with engineered activities is extremely challenging. In directed evolution, repeated cycles of genetic diversification followed by a screening or selection process, can be used to mimic natural selection in the laboratory to design new proteins with a desired activity. Several methods exist for creating large libraries of sequence variants. Among the most widely used are subjecting DNA to UV radiation or chemical mutagens, error-prone PCR, degenerate codons, or recombination. Once a large library of variants is created, selection or screening techniques are used to find mutants with a desired attribute.", "metadata": {"pageid": "1686272", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1686272", "title": "Chemical biology", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "1686272_chunk_7", "chunk_id": 7, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 42, "end_sentence": 49, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\1686272.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "1686272_chunk_8", "text": "Among the most widely used are subjecting DNA to UV radiation or chemical mutagens, error-prone PCR, degenerate codons, or recombination.

Once useful variants are found, their DNA sequence is amplified and subjected to further rounds of diversification and selection. The development of directed evolution methods was honored in 2018 with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frances Arnold for evolution of enzymes, and George Smith and Gregory Winter for phage display. === Bioorthogonal reactions === Successful labeling of a molecule of interest requires specific functionalization of that molecule to react chemospecifically with an optical probe. For a labeling experiment to be considered robust, that functionalization must minimally perturb the system. These requirements are often difficult to meet.", "metadata": {"pageid": "1686272", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1686272", "title": "Chemical biology", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "1686272_chunk_8", "chunk_id": 8, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 48, "end_sentence": 55, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\1686272.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "1686272_chunk_9", "text": "For a labeling experiment to be considered robust, that functionalization must minimally perturb the system.

Water- and redox- sensitive reactions would not proceed, reagents prone to nucleophilic attack would offer no chemospecificity, and any reactions with large kinetic barriers would not find enough energy in the relatively low-heat environment of a living cell. Thus, chemists have recently developed a panel of bioorthogonal chemistry that proceed chemospecifically, despite the milieu of distracting reactive materials in vivo. The coupling of a probe to a molecule of interest must occur within a reasonably short time frame; therefore, the kinetics of the coupling reaction should be highly favorable. Click chemistry is well suited to fill this niche, since click reactions are rapid, spontaneous, selective, and high-yielding.

Mathematics involves the description and manipulation of abstract objects that consist of either abstractions from nature or\u2014in modern mathematics\u2014purely abstract entities that are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. Mathematics uses pure reason to prove the properties of objects through proofs, which consist of a succession of applications of deductive rules to already established results.

Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements. Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetics (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions) until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both. At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method, which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application.

Al-Khwarizmi introduced systematic methods for transforming equations, such as moving a term from one side of an equation into the other side. The term algebra is derived from the Arabic word al-jabr meaning 'the reunion of broken parts' that he used for naming one of these methods in the title of his main treatise. Algebra became an area in its own right only with Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te (1540\u20131603), who introduced the use of variables for representing unknown or unspecified numbers. Variables allow mathematicians to describe the operations that have to be done on the numbers represented using mathematical formulas. Until the 19th century, algebra consisted mainly of the study of linear equations (presently linear algebra), and polynomial equations in a single unknown, which were called algebraic equations (a term still in use, although it may be ambiguous).

The concept of algebraic structure addresses this, consisting of a set whose elements are unspecified, of operations acting on the elements of the set, and rules that these operations must follow. The scope of algebra thus grew to include the study of algebraic structures. This object of algebra was called modern algebra or abstract algebra, as established by the influence and works of Emmy Noether, and popularized by Van der Waerden's book Moderne Algebra. Some types of algebraic structures have useful and often fundamental properties, in many areas of mathematics. Their study became autonomous parts of algebra, and include: group theory field theory vector spaces, whose study is essentially the same as linear algebra ring theory commutative algebra, which is the study of commutative rings, includes the study of polynomials, and is a foundational part of algebraic geometry homological algebra Lie algebra and Lie group theory Boolean algebra, which is widely used for the study of the logical structure of computers The study of types of algebraic structures as mathematical objects is the purpose of universal algebra and category theory.

At its origin, it was introduced, together with homological algebra for allowing the algebraic study of non-algebraic objects such as topological spaces; this particular area of application is called algebraic topology. === Calculus and analysis === Calculus, formerly called infinitesimal calculus, was introduced independently and simultaneously by 17th-century mathematicians Newton and Leibniz. It is fundamentally the study of the relationship between variables that depend continuously on each other. Calculus was expanded in the 18th century by Euler with the introduction of the concept of a function and many other results.

An example is the set of all integers. Because the objects of study here are discrete, the methods of calculus and mathematical analysis do not directly apply. Algorithms\u2014especially their implementation and computational complexity\u2014play a major role in discrete mathematics.

Discrete mathematics includes: Combinatorics, the art of enumerating mathematical objects that satisfy some given constraints. Originally, these objects were elements or subsets of a given set; this has been extended to various objects, which establishes a strong link between combinatorics and other parts of discrete mathematics. For example, discrete geometry includes counting configurations of geometric shapes. Graph theory and hypergraphs Coding theory, including error correcting codes and a part of cryptography Matroid theory Discrete geometry Discrete probability distributions Game theory (although continuous games are also studied, most common games, such as chess and poker are discrete) Discrete optimization, including combinatorial optimization, integer programming, constraint programming === Mathematical logic and set theory === The two subjects of mathematical logic and set theory have belonged to mathematics since the end of the 19th century.

Cantor's work offended many mathematicians not only by considering actually infinite sets but by showing that this implies different sizes of infinity, per Cantor's diagonal argument. This led to the controversy over Cantor's set theory. In the same period, various areas of mathematics concluded the former intuitive definitions of the basic mathematical objects were insufficient for ensuring mathematical rigour.

This mathematical abstraction from reality is embodied in the modern philosophy of formalism, as founded by David Hilbert around 1910. The \"nature\" of the objects defined this way is a philosophical problem that mathematicians leave to philosophers, even if many mathematicians have opinions on this nature, and use their opinion\u2014sometimes called \"intuition\"\u2014to guide their study and proofs.

This approach to the foundations of mathematics was challenged during the first half of the 20th century by mathematicians led by Brouwer, who promoted intuitionistic logic (which explicitly lacks the law of excluded middle). These problems and debates led to a wide expansion of mathematical logic, with subareas such as model theory (modeling some logical theories inside other theories), proof theory, type theory, computability theory and computational complexity theory. Although these aspects of mathematical logic were introduced before the rise of computers, their use in compiler design, formal verification, program analysis, proof assistants and other aspects of computer science, contributed in turn to the expansion of these logical theories. === Statistics and other decision sciences === The field of statistics is a mathematical application that is employed for the collection and processing of data samples, using procedures based on mathematical methods such as, and especially, probability theory.

Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics. During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables.

It entered the English language during the Late Middle English period through French and Latin. Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the math\u0113matikoi (\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af)\u2014which at the time meant \"learners\" rather than \"mathematicians\" in the modern sense.

The Pythagoreans were likely the first to constrain the use of the word to just the study of arithmetic and geometry. By the time of Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC) this meaning was fully established. In Latin and English, until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant \"astrology\" (or sometimes \"astronomy\") rather than \"mathematics\"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This change has resulted in several mistranslations: For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of mathematici, meaning \"astrologers\", is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians. The apparent plural form in English goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural ta math\u0113matik\u00e1 (\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac) and means roughly \"all things mathematical\", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, inherited from Greek.

However, the lines between the two are frequently blurred. The aftermath of World War II led to a surge in the development of applied mathematics in the US and elsewhere. Many of the theories developed for applications were found interesting from the point of view of pure mathematics, and many results of pure mathematics were shown to have applications outside mathematics; in turn, the study of these applications may give new insights on the \"pure theory\". An example of the first case is the theory of distributions, introduced by Laurent Schwartz for validating computations done in quantum mechanics, which became immediately an important tool of (pure) mathematical analysis. An example of the second case is the decidability of the first-order theory of the real numbers, a problem of pure mathematics that was proved true by Alfred Tarski, with an algorithm that is impossible to implement because of a computational complexity that is much too high.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18831", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18831", "title": "Mathematics", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18831_chunk_34", "chunk_id": 34, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 204, "end_sentence": 211, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18831.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18831_chunk_35", "text": "An example of the first case is the theory of distributions, introduced by Laurent Schwartz for validating computations done in quantum mechanics, which became immediately an important tool of (pure) mathematical analysis.

For getting an algorithm that can be implemented and can solve systems of polynomial equations and inequalities, George Collins introduced the cylindrical algebraic decomposition that became a fundamental tool in real algebraic geometry. In the present day, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a question of personal research aim of mathematicians than a division of mathematics into broad areas. The Mathematics Subject Classification has a section for \"general applied mathematics\" but does not mention \"pure mathematics\". However, these terms are still used in names of some university departments, such as at the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. === Unreasonable effectiveness === The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is a phenomenon that was named and first made explicit by physicist Eugene Wigner.

At this time, these concepts seemed totally disconnected from the physical reality, but at the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity that uses fundamentally these concepts. In particular, spacetime of special relativity is a non-Euclidean space of dimension four, and spacetime of general relativity is a (curved) manifold of dimension four.

The ancient philosopher Plato argued that abstractions that reflect material reality have themselves a reality that exists outside space and time. As a result, the philosophical view that mathematical objects somehow exist on their own in abstraction is often referred to as Platonism. Independently of their possible philosophical opinions, modern mathematicians may be generally considered as Platonists, since they think of and talk of their objects of study as real objects.

Because the language of mathematics is so precise, it is ideally suited to defining concepts for which such a consensus exists. In my opinion, that is sufficient to provide us with a feeling of an objective existence, of a reality of mathematics ...

A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable. There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science. Some just say, \"mathematics is what mathematicians do\". A common approach is to define mathematics by its object of study. Aristotle defined mathematics as \"the science of quantity\" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century.

For example, in lieu of a definition, Saunders Mac Lane in Mathematics, form and function summarizes the basics of several areas of mathematics, emphasizing their inter-connectedness, and observes: the development of Mathematics provides a tightly connected network of formal rules, concepts, and systems.

The concept of rigor in mathematics dates back to ancient Greece, where their society encouraged logical, deductive reasoning. However, this rigorous approach would tend to discourage exploration of new approaches, such as irrational numbers and concepts of infinity. The method of demonstrating rigorous proof was enhanced in the sixteenth century through the use of symbolic notation.

On the contrary, many important mathematical results (theorems) are solutions of problems that other mathematicians failed to solve, and the invention of a way for solving them may be a fundamental way of the solving process. An extreme example is Apery's theorem: Roger Apery provided only the ideas for a proof, and the formal proof was given only several months later by three other mathematicians.

Stated in 1742 by Christian Goldbach, it remains unproven despite considerable effort. Number theory includes several subareas, including analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, geometry of numbers (method oriented), Diophantine analysis, and transcendence theory (problem oriented). === Geometry === Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics.

The basic statements are not subject to proof because they are self-evident (postulates), or are part of the definition of the subject of study (axioms). This principle, foundational for all mathematics, was first elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by Euclid around 300 BC in his book Elements. The resulting Euclidean geometry is the study of shapes and their arrangements constructed from lines, planes and circles in the Euclidean plane (plane geometry) and the three-dimensional Euclidean space. Euclidean geometry was developed without change of methods or scope until the 17th century, when Ren\u00e9 Descartes introduced what is now called Cartesian coordinates.

Analytic geometry allows the study of curves unrelated to circles and lines. Such curves can be defined as the graph of functions, the study of which led to differential geometry. They can also be defined as implicit equations, often polynomial equations (which spawned algebraic geometry).

This aspect of the crisis was solved by systematizing the axiomatic method, and adopting that the truth of the chosen axioms is not a mathematical problem. In turn, the axiomatic method allows for the study of various geometries obtained either by changing the axioms or by considering properties that do not change under specific transformations of the space. Today's subareas of geometry include: Projective geometry, introduced in the 16th century by Girard Desargues, extends Euclidean geometry by adding points at infinity at which parallel lines intersect.

Musical notation was used since ancient times in Greek culture, but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the Catholic Church, so chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found, in written form, from before 800 is the monophonic liturgical plainsong chant of the Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant. Alongside these traditions of sacred and church music there existed a vibrant tradition of secular song (non-religious songs).

Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as Wagner and Brahms attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the syncretism of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. Romantic love or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period.

In the years after 1800, the music developed by Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short motifs, developed organically, came to replace melody as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his Fifth Symphony).

Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do urban society. It also saw a new diversity in theatre music, including operetta, and musical comedy and other forms of musical theatre. === 20th and 21st century === In the 19th century, a key way new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home, on their piano or other common instruments, such as the violin. With 20th-century music, the invention of new electric technologies such as radio broadcasting and mass market availability of gramophone records meant sound recordings heard by listeners (on the radio or record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces.

As well, people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations.

Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes, improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung note.

In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \"score\", which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.

The Latin word musica was also the originator for both the Spanish m\u00fasica and French musique via spelling and linguistic adjustment, though other European terms were probably loanwords, including the Italian musica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Norwegian musikk, Polish muzyka and Russian muz\u00efka. The modern Western world usually defines music as an all-encompassing term used to describe diverse genres, styles, and traditions. This is not the case worldwide, and languages such as modern Indonesian (musik) and Shona (musakazo) have recently adopted words to reflect this universal conception, as they did not have words that fit exactly the Western scope. Before Western contact in East Asia, neither Japan nor China had a single word that encompasses music in a broad sense, but culturally, they often regarded music in such a fashion.

In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead, compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed \"interpretation\". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies.

The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as performance practice, whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer. Although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the blues, a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds.

Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music, and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Witold Lutos\u0142awski. A commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers. === Performance === Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or piano piece, guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other musical part is played.

As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a cover song, they can make changes such as adding a guitar solo or inserting an introduction. A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)\u2014which is the norm in classical music, jazz big bands, and many popular music styles\u2013or improvised over a chord progression (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small jazz and blues groups.

Some music lovers create mix tapes of favourite songs, which serve as a \"self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved\". Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure and derive income elsewhere.

When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a melody, are notated. Music notation often provides instructions on how to perform the music.

Africa is too diverse to make firm generalizations, but the musicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has emphasized African music's often inseparable connection to dance and speech in general. Some African cultures, such as the Songye people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Tiv people of Nigeria, have a strong and broad conception of 'music' but no corresponding word in their native languages. Other words commonly translated as music often have more specific meanings in their respective cultures: the Hindi word for music, sangita, properly refers to art music, while the many Indigenous languages of the Americas have words for music that refer specifically to song but describe instrumental music regardless.

To read notation, a person must have an understanding of music theory, harmony and the performance practice associated with a particular song or piece's genre. Written notation varies with the style and period of music. Nowadays, notated music is produced as sheet music or, for individuals with computer scorewriter programs, as an image on a computer screen. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or genre.

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the lead sheet, which notates the melody, chords, lyrics (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. Fake books are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit rhythm section members to improvise an accompaniment part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz \"big bands.\" In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in tablature (often abbreviated as \"tab\"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tablature was used in the Baroque era to notate music for the lute, a stringed, fretted instrument. === Oral and aural tradition === Many types of music, such as traditional blues and folk music were not written down in sheet music; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down orally, from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song \"by ear\".", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_41", "chunk_id": 41, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 246, "end_sentence": 253, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_42", "text": "Tablature was used in the Baroque era to notate music for the lute, a stringed, fretted instrument. === Oral and aural tradition === Many types of music, such as traditional blues and folk music were not written down in sheet music; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down orally, from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song \"by ear\". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as \"traditional\" or as a \"folk song\". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song. == Elements == Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of \"element\" being used, these can include pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form, and structure.

All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre, and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed upon. Below is a list of the three official versions of the \"elements of music\": Australia: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics and expression, rhythm, form and structure. UK: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics, duration, tempo, structure. USA: pitch, timbre, texture, dynamics, rhythm, form, harmony, style/articulation. In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: \"appropriate musical notations\" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the \"elements of music\" to the \"inter-related dimensions of music\".

The phrase \"the elements of music\" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the \"rudimentary elements of music\" and the \"perceptual elements of music\". === Pitch === Pitch is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note, or tone is \"higher\" or \"lower\" than another musical sound, note, or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high piccolo note or whistling tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a bass drum. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical melodies, basslines and chords. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_44", "chunk_id": 44, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 264, "end_sentence": 271, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_45", "text": "We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical melodies, basslines and chords. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano than to try to discern the pitch of a crash cymbal that is struck. === Melody === A melody, also called a \"tune\", is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as scales or modes. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or key of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and C; these are the \"white notes\" on a piano keyboard.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_45", "chunk_id": 45, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 270, "end_sentence": 277, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_46", "text": "The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or key of a given song.

On the other hand, Bebop-era jazz from the 1940s and contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many chromatic notes (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the \"white notes\" and \"black notes\" and unusual scales, such as the whole tone scale (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F\u266f, G\u266f and A\u266f). A low musical line played by bass instruments, such as double bass, electric bass, or tuba, is called a bassline. === Harmony === Harmony refers to the \"vertical\" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time creates a chord. Usually, this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor tonality (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock, and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the \"home note\" or tonic to which the piece generally resolves, and the character (e.g. major or minor) of the scale in use.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_46", "chunk_id": 46, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 276, "end_sentence": 283, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_47", "text": "In music written using the system of major-minor tonality (\"keys\"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock, and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the \"home note\" or tonic to which the piece generally resolves, and the character (e.g. major or minor) of the scale in use. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop, and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820\u20131900) often contains multiple keys, as does jazz, especially Bebop jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or \"home note\" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars. === Rhythm === Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. Meter animates time in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars, which in Western classical, popular, and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as Waltz time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time).

Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the backbeat used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or common time) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the snare drum, a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the rhythm section, which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as jazz and bluegrass, double bass) and a drum kit player. === Texture === Musical texture is the overall sound of a piece of music or song. The texture of a piece or song is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_48", "chunk_id": 48, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 288, "end_sentence": 295, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_49", "text": "Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below).

Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between parts or lines of music: monophony: a single melody (or \"tune\") with neither instrumental accompaniment nor a harmony part. A mother singing a lullaby to her baby would be an example. heterophony: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different ornaments to the melody.

Many scholars highlight a relationship between the origin of music and the origin of language, and there is disagreement surrounding whether music developed before, after, or simultaneously with language. A similar source of contention surrounds whether music was the intentional result of natural selection or was a byproduct spandrel of evolution. The earliest influential theory was proposed by Charles Darwin in 1871, who stated that music arose as a form of sexual selection, perhaps via mating calls. Darwin's original perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other sexual selection methods, though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted the theory. Other theories include that music arose to assist in organizing labor, improving long-distance communication, benefiting communication with the divine, assisting in community cohesion or as a defense to scare off predators.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_5", "chunk_id": 5, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 30, "end_sentence": 37, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_50", "text": "heterophony: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different ornaments to the melody.

Choral music written in the Renaissance music era was typically written in this style. A round, which is a song such as \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is an example of polyphony. homophony: a clear melody supported by chordal accompaniment. Most Western popular music songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture. Music that contains a large number of independent parts (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a \"thicker\" or \"denser\" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo flute melody accompanied by a single cello).", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_50", "chunk_id": 50, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 300, "end_sentence": 307, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_51", "text": "Most Western popular music songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440 Hz A note sounds different when it is played on oboe, piano, violin, or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different embouchures), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., gut strings versus steel strings). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently). The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the spectrum, envelope, and overtones of a note or musical sound.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_51", "chunk_id": 51, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 306, "end_sentence": 313, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_52", "text": "Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently). The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the spectrum, envelope, and overtones of a note or musical sound. For electric instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and electric piano, the performer can also change the tone by adjusting equalizer controls, tone controls on the instrument, and by using electronic effects units such as distortion pedals. The tone of the electric Hammond organ is controlled by adjusting drawbars. === Expression === Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding phrasing, by adding effects such as vibrato (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments, and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., ritardando or accelerando, which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or fermatas on a cadence, and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more legato, which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter). Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato, etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_52", "chunk_id": 52, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 312, "end_sentence": 319, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_53", "text": "Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato, etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements to convey \"an indication of mood, spirit, character etc.\" and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music, although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music. === Form === In music, form describes the overall structure or plan of a song or piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections. In the early 20th century, Tin Pan Alley songs and Broadway musical songs were often in AABA thirty-two-bar form, in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody (with variation) and the B section provided a contrasting melody or harmony for eight bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in verse-chorus form, which comprises a sequence of verse and chorus (\"refrain\") sections, with new lyrics for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses.

Popular music often makes use of strophic form, sometimes in conjunction with the twelve bar blues. In the tenth edition of The Oxford Companion to Music, Percy Scholes defines musical form as \"a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration.\" Examples of common forms of Western music include the fugue, the invention, sonata-allegro, canon, strophic, theme and variations, and rondo. Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and fugue (although musicologist Alfred Mann emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.) Where a piece cannot readily be broken into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or programme), it is said to be through-composed. Such is often the case with a fantasia, prelude, rhapsody, etude (or study), symphonic poem, Bagatelle, impromptu or similar composition. Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as \"sectional, developmental, or variational.\" == Philosophy == The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music and has connections with questions in metaphysics and aesthetics. Questions include: What is the definition of music? (What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for classifying something as music?) What is the relationship between music and mind?", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_54", "chunk_id": 54, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 324, "end_sentence": 331, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_55", "text": "Questions include: What is the definition of music?

In ancient times, such as with the Ancient Greeks, the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music.

Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been foregrounded. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by Peter Kivy, Jerrold Levinson, Roger Scruton, and Stephen Davies. However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music.

Harry Partch and some other musicologists, such as Kyle Gann, have studied and tried to popularize microtonal music and the usage of alternate musical scales. Modern composers like La Monte Young, Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca paid much attention to a scale called just intonation. It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions, intellect, and psychology; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. Plato suggests in The Republic that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

Research in this field and its subfields are primarily empirical; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music performance, composition, education, criticism, and therapy, as well as investigations of human aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and social behavior. === Neuroscience === Cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music.

The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

Prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from paleolithic archaeology sites. The disputed Divje Babe flute, a perforated cave bear femur, is at least 40,000 years old, though there is considerable debate surrounding whether it is truly a musical instrument or an object formed by animals.

An alternate view sees music as a by-product of linguistic evolution; a type of \"auditory cheesecake\" that pleases the senses without providing any adaptive function. This view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers. === Cultural effects === An individual's culture or ethnicity plays a role in their music cognition, including their preferences, emotional reaction, and musical memory.

C.E. Seashore, in his book Psychology of Music, identified four \"psychological attributes of sound\". These were: \"pitch, loudness, time, and timbre\" (p. 3).

This usage of the phrase \"the elements of music\" links more closely with Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary definition of an element as: \"a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods\" and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well. Although writers of lists of \"rudimentary elements of music\" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings from being alone, to attending a large concert, forming a music community, which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there was a divide between what types of music were viewed as \"high culture\" and \"low culture.\" \"High culture\" included Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly. Other types of music\u2014including jazz, blues, soul, and country\u2014are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may drink, dance and cheer. Until the 20th century, the division between \"high\" and \"low\" musical forms was accepted as a valid distinction that separated out \"art music\", from popular music heard in bars and dance halls.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_64", "chunk_id": 64, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 384, "end_sentence": 391, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_65", "text": "Other types of music\u2014including jazz, blues, soul, and country\u2014are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may drink, dance and cheer.

Musicologists, such as David Brackett, note a \"redrawing of high-low cultural-aesthetic boundaries\" in the 20th century. And, \"when industry and public discourses link categories of music with categories of people, they tend to conflate stereotypes with actual listening communities.\" Stereotypes can be based on socioeconomic standing, or social class, of the performers or audience of the different types of music. When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be strong resistance from academics and others. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, serialism, bebop, hip hop, punk rock, and electronica were controversial and criticised, when they were first introduced. Such themes are examined in the sociology of music, sometimes called sociomusicology, which is pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to ethnomusicology. === Role of women === Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18839", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18839", "title": "Music", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_65", "chunk_id": 65, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 390, "end_sentence": 397, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18839.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18839_chunk_66", "text": "Such themes are examined in the sociology of music, sometimes called sociomusicology, which is pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to ethnomusicology. === Role of women === Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions.

Although there have been a huge number of women composers in classical music, from the medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the commonly performed classical music repertoire, music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the Concise Oxford History of Music, Clara Schumann is one of the few female composers who is mentioned. Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra were men.

In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as talking pictures emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work. During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and theater organists were common at first-run theaters.

The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via streaming video and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. Another effect of the Internet arose with online communities and social media websites like YouTube and Facebook, a social networking service.

Students can pursue study of musicology, ethnomusicology, music history, and music theory through different types of degrees, including bachelor's, master's and PhD. === Music theory === Music theory is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines.

Speculative music theory, contrasted with analytic music theory, is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example tuning systems, generally as preparation for composition. === Zoomusicology === Zoomusicology is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, \"do animals have music?\" Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che's Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion (1983), a study of \"ornitho-musicology\" using a technique of Nicolas Ruwet's Language, musique, po\u00e9sie (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that bird songs are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle.

The history of music in non-Western cultures (\"world music\" or the field of \"ethnomusicology\") is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures.

Musical education was considered important for the development of an individual's soul. Musicians and singers played a prominent role in Greek theater, and those who received a musical education were seen as nobles and in perfect harmony (as can be read in the Republic, Plato). Mixed gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies.

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the definition of music. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or \"art\" music), and popular music (or commercial music \u2013 including non-Western styles of rock, country, and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these \"big two\" classifications, (such as folk music, world music, or jazz-related music).

Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's Porgy and Bess and Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story are claimed by both opera and the Broadway musical tradition. Many music festivals for non-Western music, include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

Research within psychiatry is conducted by psychiatrists on an interdisciplinary basis with other professionals, including clinical psychologists, epidemiologists, nurses, social workers, and occupational therapists. Psychiatry has been controversial since its inception, facing criticism both internally and externally over its medicalization of mental distress, reliance on pharmaceuticals, use of coercion, influence from the pharmaceutical industry, and its historical role in social control and contentious treatments. Due to the absence of objective biological pathology (such as tissue damage or biomarkers), prominent critics such as Thomas Szasz and Peter Breggin have characterized the field as a pseudoscience or a form of social control masquerading as medicine.

Evolutionary psychiatry (or Darwinian psychiatry) is a theoretical orientation within psychiatry that applies principles from evolutionary biology\u2014such as natural selection, adaptation, mismatch, and trade\u2010offs\u2014to frame hypotheses about the origins, persistence, and variation of mental disorders. In larger healthcare organizations, psychiatrists often serve in senior management roles, where they are responsible for the efficient and effective delivery of mental health services for the organization's constituents.

Clinical and research psychiatrists study basic and clinical psychiatric topics at research institutions and publish articles in journals. Under the supervision of institutional review boards, psychiatric clinical researchers look at topics such as neuroimaging, genetics, and psychopharmacology in order to enhance diagnostic validity and reliability, to discover new treatment methods, and to classify new mental disorders. == Clinical application == === Diagnostic systems === Psychiatric diagnoses take place in a wide variety of settings and are performed by many different health professionals. Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a differential diagnosis procedure where a mental status examination and physical examination is conducted, with pathological, psychopathological or psychosocial histories obtained, and sometimes neuroimages or other neurophysiological measurements are taken, or personality tests or cognitive tests administered.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18973869", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18973869", "title": "Psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18973869_chunk_13", "chunk_id": 13, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 78, "end_sentence": 85, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18973869.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18973869_chunk_14", "text": "Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors.

In some cases, a brain scan might be used to rule out other medical illnesses, but at this time relying on brain scans alone cannot accurately diagnose a mental illness or tell the risk of getting a mental illness in the future. Some clinicians are beginning to utilize genetics and automated speech assessment during the diagnostic process but on the whole these remain research topics. === Potential use of MRI/fMRI in diagnosis === In 2018, the American Psychological Association commissioned a review to reach a consensus on whether modern clinical MRI/fMRI will be able to be used in the diagnosis of mental health disorders. The criteria presented by the APA stated that the biomarkers used in diagnosis should: \"have a sensitivity of at least 80% for detecting a particular psychiatric disorder\" \"should have a specificity of at least 80% for distinguishing this disorder from other psychiatric or medical disorders\" \"should be reliable, reproducible, and ideally be noninvasive, simple to perform, and inexpensive\" \"proposed biomarkers should be verified by 2 independent studies each by a different investigator and different population samples and published in a peer-reviewed journal\" The review concluded that although neuroimaging diagnosis may technically be feasible, very large studies are needed to evaluate specific biomarkers which were not available. === Diagnostic manuals === Three main diagnostic manuals used to classify mental health conditions are in use today.

It is currently in its fifth revised edition and is also used worldwide. The Chinese Society of Psychiatry has also produced a diagnostic manual, the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders. The stated intention of diagnostic manuals is typically to develop replicable and clinically useful categories and criteria, to facilitate consensus and agreed upon standards, whilst being atheoretical as regards etiology.

The DSM has attracted praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria. It has also attracted controversy and criticism. Some critics argue that the DSM represents an unscientific system that enshrines the opinions of a few powerful psychiatrists. There are ongoing issues concerning the validity and reliability of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial symptoms; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from 'normality'; possible cultural bias; medicalization of human distress and financial conflicts of interest, including with the practice of psychiatrists and with the pharmaceutical industry; political controversies about the inclusion or exclusion of diagnoses from the manual, in general or in regard to specific issues; and the experience of those who are most directly affected by the manual by being diagnosed, including the consumer/survivor movement. == Treatment == === General considerations === Individuals receiving psychiatric treatment are commonly referred to as patients but may also be called clients, consumers, or service recipients.

Alternatively, a person may be referred by hospital medical staff, by court order, involuntary commitment, or, in countries such as the UK and Australia, by sectioning under a mental health law. A psychiatrist or medical provider evaluates people through a psychiatric assessment for their mental and physical condition. This usually involves interviewing the person and often obtaining information from other sources such as other health and social care professionals, relatives, associates, law enforcement personnel, emergency medical personnel, and psychiatric rating scales. A mental status examination is carried out, and a physical examination is usually performed to establish or exclude other illnesses that may be contributing to the alleged psychiatric problems. A physical examination may also serve to identify any signs of self-harm; this examination is often performed by someone other than the psychiatrist, especially if blood tests and medical imaging are performed.

However, in Japan psychiatric hospitals continue to keep patients for long periods, sometimes even keeping them in physical restraints, strapped to their beds for periods of weeks or months. Psychiatric inpatients are people admitted to a hospital or clinic to receive psychiatric care. Some are admitted involuntarily, perhaps committed to a secure hospital, or in some jurisdictions to a facility within the prison system.

Additionally, the 'chemical imbalance' theory used to market psychiatric drugs for decades was recently identified as empirically unsubstantiated by a major 2022 review, leading to accusations of systemic pharmaceutical marketing fraud. Furthermore, the paradigm of chronic pharmaceutical maintenance has been challenged by longitudinal studies, such as the 20-year Chicago Follow-up Study (Harrow et al.), which found that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who discontinued antipsychotic medication achieved significantly higher rates of functional recovery and employment compared to those who remained medicated. == Etymology == The term psychiatry was first coined by the German physician Johann Christian Reil in 1808 and literally means the 'medical treatment of the soul' (\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae psych- 'soul' from Ancient Greek psykh\u0113 'soul'; -iatry 'medical treatment' from Gk. \u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 i\u0101trikos 'medical' from \u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 i\u0101sthai 'to heal').

During initial appointments, a psychiatrist generally conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient. Follow-up appointments then focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patient's mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms.

Increasingly, psychiatrists are limiting their practices to psychopharmacology (prescribing medications), as opposed to previous practice in which a psychiatrist would provide traditional 50-minute psychotherapy sessions, of which psychopharmacology would be a part, but most of the consultation sessions consisted of \"talk therapy\". This shift began in the early 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s. A major reason for this change was the advent of managed care insurance plans, which began to limit reimbursement for psychotherapy sessions provided by psychiatrists. The underlying assumption was that psychopharmacology was at least as effective as psychotherapy, and it could be delivered more efficiently because less time is required for the appointment. Because of this shift in practice patterns, psychiatrists often refer patients whom they think would benefit from psychotherapy to other mental health professionals, e.g., clinical social workers and psychologists. === Telepsychiatry === == History == === Earliest knowledge === The earliest known texts on mental disorders are from ancient India and include the Ayurvedic text, Charaka Samhita.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18973869", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18973869", "title": "Psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18973869_chunk_24", "chunk_id": 24, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 144, "end_sentence": 151, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18973869.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18973869_chunk_25", "text": "Because of this shift in practice patterns, psychiatrists often refer patients whom they think would benefit from psychotherapy to other mental health professionals, e.g., clinical social workers and psychologists. === Telepsychiatry === == History == === Earliest knowledge === The earliest known texts on mental disorders are from ancient India and include the Ayurvedic text, Charaka Samhita.

People who specialize in psychiatry often differ from most other mental health professionals and physicians in that they must be familiar with both the social and biological sciences. The discipline studies the operations of different organs and body systems as classified by the patient's subjective experiences and the objective physiology of the patient. Psychiatry treats mental disorders, which are conventionally divided into three general categories: mental illnesses, severe learning disabilities, and personality disorders. Although the focus of psychiatry has changed little over time, the diagnostic and treatment processes have evolved dramatically and continue to do so. Since the late 20th century, the field of psychiatry has continued to become more biological and less conceptually isolated from other medical fields. === Scope of practice === Though the medical specialty of psychiatry uses research in the field of neuroscience, psychology, medicine, biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology, it has generally been considered a middle ground between neurology and psychology.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18973869", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18973869", "title": "Psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18973869_chunk_3", "chunk_id": 3, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 18, "end_sentence": 25, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18973869.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18973869_chunk_30", "text": "=== Medical specialty === The beginning of psychiatry as a medical specialty is dated to the middle of the nineteenth century, although its germination can be traced to the late eighteenth century.

He argued that mental disorder originated from dysfunction of the material brain and body rather than the internal workings of the mind.

However, the idea that mental illness could be ameliorated through institutionalization ran into difficulties. Psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population, and asylums again became almost indistinguishable from custodial institutions. In the early 1800s, psychiatry made advances in the diagnosis of mental illness by broadening the category of mental disease to include mood disorders, in addition to disease level delusion or irrationality. The 20th century introduced a new psychiatry into the world, with different perspectives of looking at mental disorders.

Following Sigmund Freud's pioneering work, ideas stemming from psychoanalytic theory also began to take root in psychiatry. The psychoanalytic theory became popular among psychiatrists because it allowed the patients to be treated in private practices instead of warehoused in asylums. By the 1970s, however, the psychoanalytic school of thought became marginalized within the field. Biological psychiatry reemerged during this time.

In a wide range of studies in neurochemistry using human and animal samples, individual differences in neurotransmitters' production, reuptake, receptors' density and locations were linked to differences in dispositions for specific psychiatric disorders. For example, the discovery of chlorpromazine's effectiveness in treating schizophrenia in 1952 revolutionized treatment of the disorder, as did lithium carbonate's ability to stabilize mood highs and lows in bipolar disorder in 1948. Psychotherapy was still utilized, but as a treatment for psychosocial issues. This proved the idea of neurochemical nature of many psychiatric disorders.

Ultimately there were no arrangements made for actively following and treating severely mentally ill patients who were being discharged from hospitals, resulting in a large population of chronically homeless people with mental illness. == Controversy and criticism == The institution of psychiatry has attracted controversy since its inception. Scholars including those from social psychiatry, psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, and critical psychiatry have produced critiques. It has been argued that psychiatry confuses disorders of the mind with disorders of the brain that can be treated with drugs; that its use of drugs is in part due to lobbying by drug companies resulting in distortion of research; and that the concept of \"mental illness\" is often used to label and control those with beliefs and behaviours that the majority of people disagree with; and that it is too influenced by ideas from medicine causing it to misunderstand the nature of mental distress.", "metadata": {"pageid": "18973869", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=18973869", "title": "Psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "18973869_chunk_37", "chunk_id": 37, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 222, "end_sentence": 229, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\18973869.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "18973869_chunk_38", "text": "Scholars including those from social psychiatry, psychoanalysis, psychotherapy, and critical psychiatry have produced critiques.

The scientific validity of psychiatric diagnosis has been challenged due to the lack of objective biological markers. In 2013, Thomas Insel, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), stated that the DSM lacks validity because diagnoses are based on consensus rather than objective laboratory measures. Critique of psychiatry from within the field comes from the critical psychiatry group in the UK. Double argues that most critical psychiatry is anti-reductionist.

Unlike other physicians and neurologists, psychiatrists specialize in the doctor\u2013patient relationship and are trained to varying extents in the use of psychotherapy and other therapeutic communication techniques. Psychiatrists also differ from psychologists in that they are physicians and have post-graduate training called residency (usually four to five years) in psychiatry; the quality and thoroughness of their graduate medical training is identical to that of all other physicians. Psychiatrists can therefore counsel patients, prescribe medication, order laboratory tests, order neuroimaging, and conduct physical examinations.

Research has also been done investigating how media portraying positive social acts, prosocial behavior, could lead to more helping behavior in its viewers. The general learning model was established to study how this process of translating media into behavior works, and why.

These effects were not only found with video games, but also with music, as people listening to songs involving aggression and violence in the lyrics were more likely to act in an aggressive manner. Likewise, people listening to songs related to prosocial acts (relative to a song with neutral lyrics) were shown to express greater helping behaviors and more empathy afterwards. When these songs were played at restaurants, it even led to an increase in tips given (relative to those who heard neutral lyrics). == Individual and group behavior == Conformity refers to the behavior that an individual is unconsciously pressured by the group to make his behavior tend to be consistent with the majority of people in the group.

Social anxiety disorder is a phobic disorder characterized by a fear of being judged by others, which manifests itself as a fear of people in general. Due to this pervasive fear of embarrassing oneself in front of others, it causes those affected to avoid interactions with other people.

The development of behavior is deeply tied with the biological and cognitive changes one is experiencing at any given time. This creates general patterns of social behavior development in humans. Just as social behavior is influenced by both the situation and an individual's characteristics, the development of behavior is due to the combination of the two as well\u2014the temperament of the child along with the settings they are exposed to.

What takes particular precedence in the influence of the setting are the people that the child must interact with their age, sex, and at times culture. Emotions also play a large role in the development of social behavior, as they are intertwined with the way an individual behaves. Through social interactions, emotion is understood through various verbal and nonverbal displays, and thus plays a large role in communication. Many of the processes that occur in the brain and underlay emotion often greatly correlate with the processes that are needed for social behavior as well.

Therefore, behavior is constantly changing as required, and maturity brings this on. A child must learn to balance their own desires with those of the people they interact with, and this ability to correctly respond to contextual cues and understand the intentions and desires of another person improves with age. That being said, the individual characteristics of the child (their temperament) is important to understanding how the individual learns social behaviors and cues given to them, and this learnability is not consistent across all children. === Patterns of development across the lifespan === When studying patterns of biological development across the human lifespan, there are certain patterns that are well-maintained across humans.

In pre and post-natal infancy, the behavior of the infant is correlated with that of the caregiver. The development of social behavior is influenced by their mothers' reactions to children's emotional displays. In infancy, there is already a development of the awareness of a stranger, in which case the individual is able to identify and distinguish between people. Come childhood, the individual begins to attend more to their peers, and communication begins to take a verbal form.

By puberty, general relations among same and opposite sex individuals are much more salient, and individuals begin to behave according to the norms of these situations. With increasing awareness of their sex and stereotypes that go along with it, the individual begins to choose how much they align with these stereotypes, and behaves either according to those stereotypes or not. This is also the time that individuals more often form sexual pairs.

Although there is debate on which particular regions of the brain are responsible for social behavior, some have claimed that the paracingulate cortex is activated when one person is thinking about the motives or aims of another, a means of understanding the social world and behaving accordingly. The medial prefrontal lobe has also been seen to have activation during social cognition Research has discovered through studies on rhesus monkeys that the amygdala, a region known for expressing fear, was activated specifically when the monkeys were faced with a social situation they had never encountered before. This region of the brain was shown to be sensitive to the fear that comes with a novel social situation, inhibiting social interaction.

Thus, targeting levels of oxytocin may play a role in interventions of disorders that deal with atypical social behavior. Along with vasopressin, serotonin has also been inspected in relation to social behavior in humans. It was found to be associated with human feelings of social connection, and there is a drop in serotonin when one is socially isolated or has feelings of social isolation.

In it, Ilberg defined social psychiatry as factors that affect the mental health of populations and ways in which to prevent mental illness among society. Ilberg argued that there were many factors that influenced mental health, but the majority of mental illnesses were hereditary. In 1911, German psychiatrist Max Fischer defined social psychiatry as \"the act of providing psychiatric care outside of asylums\", and advocated for the creation of welfare centers to deliver psychiatric care outside of asylums. At this time in Germany, social psychiatry emphasized protection of the general public of those who are mentally ill and 'antisocial.' ==== United States mental health community movement ==== The mental hygiene movement in the United States marked a shift from individual responsibility of mental health to how public health and society could promote mental health. In 1909, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now called Mental Health America) was created to focus on mental illness prevention and mental health promotion.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_1", "chunk_id": 1, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 6, "end_sentence": 13, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_10", "text": "Sullivan proposed that personality develops through relationships and that disruptions in these interactions often underlie psychological distress.

Interpersonal theory helped advance social psychiatry by emphasizing the significance of social and interpersonal factors in mental health, shifting the focus from purely biological explanations to a more holistic understanding of mental illness. By incorporating interpersonal dynamics and social influences into psychiatric theory, Sullivan shifted the field toward a more holistic understanding of mental health, paving the way for innovations such as family therapy, community mental health programs, and the exploration of social determinants of health. === Biopsychosocial model === The biopsychosocial model, developed by George Engel in 1977, integrates biological, psychological, and social factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of mental health.

Social psychiatry attributes those with housing instability, such as frequent moves, evictions, or homelessness, generates stress, disrupts social support networks, with higher risk of psychiatric disorders. Poor living conditions, including overcrowding, unsafe environments, and exposure to hazards like mold or lead, further exacerbate mental health challenges, particularly in children. Residential segregation, often resulting from systemic issues like redlining and gentrification, concentrates marginalized communities in under-resourced areas, perpetuating mental health disparities.

Poverty often leads to social isolation, a key topic in social psychiatry. Faris and Dunham's 1939 study was among the first to identify social isolation as a determinant to mental health. Children in poverty, social psychiatry argues, can have developmental impacts and are associated with higher risk for adverse mental health outcomes. In the medical community, poverty is considered an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE). ==== Class and socioeconomic status ==== Social psychiatry examines class and socioeconomic status (SES) as factors that shape mental health by influencing access to power, privilege, and resources.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_12", "chunk_id": 12, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 72, "end_sentence": 79, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_13", "text": "In the medical community, poverty is considered an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE). ==== Class and socioeconomic status ==== Social psychiatry examines class and socioeconomic status (SES) as factors that shape mental health by influencing access to power, privilege, and resources. Research shows that employment instability, low-paying jobs, and poor working conditions are linked to higher rates of psychological distress. In his book The Impact of Inequality: How to Make Sick Societies Healthier, British epidemiologist Richard G. Wilkinson outlines how lower-class individuals can experience \"status anxiety\" or humiliation tied to social stratification, which impacts mental health. Class disparities can also shape perceptions and treatment of mental illness, with working-class populations often encountering greater stigma and fewer resources. Social psychiatry also emphasizes the importance of intersectionality; the interplay of class, race, and gender can amplify risks for mental illness. ==== Education ==== Social psychiatry views education as both a pathway to improved mental health and a source of stress or inequity.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_13", "chunk_id": 13, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 78, "end_sentence": 85, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_14", "text": "Social psychiatry also emphasizes the importance of intersectionality; the interplay of class, race, and gender can amplify risks for mental illness. ==== Education ==== Social psychiatry views education as both a pathway to improved mental health and a source of stress or inequity. Higher levels of education often correlate with better mental health outcomes due to increased economic opportunities, problem-solving skills, and social mobility. A 2022 study, \"Mental health effects of education\", found that an extra year of education was associated with lower rates of depression and anxiety among high school students, highlighting that the impact was even stronger for women and individuals in rural communities. According to social psychiatry, disparities in educational quality and access mirror broader socioeconomic and racial inequities, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage that affect mental health. Negative school environments\u2014characterized by bullying, exclusion, or lack of culturally responsive curricula\u2014can harm students' mental well-being, particularly those from minority or marginalized groups. ==== Race and ethnicity ==== Social psychiatrists have done research on how race and ethnicity influences mental health, particularly in the context of systemic racism, migration, immigration, and globalization. Experiences of discrimination and institutional bias in areas like housing, employment, and healthcare contribute to chronic stress and poorer mental health outcomes for marginalized racial groups.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_14", "chunk_id": 14, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 84, "end_sentence": 91, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_15", "text": "==== Race and ethnicity ==== Social psychiatrists have done research on how race and ethnicity influences mental health, particularly in the context of systemic racism, migration, immigration, and globalization.

Immigrants and racial minorities may also face acculturation stress and identity conflicts, further affecting their mental well-being. However, some communities develop strong cultural or social bonds that act as protective factors against the effects of racism, a key area of interest in social psychiatry. Racial disparities in mental health care access, often influenced by cultural stigma, exacerbate untreated conditions and highlight the need for culturally informed interventions. Social psychiatry leverages these insights to advocate for policies that promote housing security, equitable education, anti-discrimination measures, and economic redistribution. These systemic changes aim to address the root causes of mental health disparities and improve overall population mental health. ==== Gender ==== Epidemiological studies have consistently found that women experience more mental health disorders compared to men.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_15", "chunk_id": 15, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 90, "end_sentence": 97, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_16", "text": "These systemic changes aim to address the root causes of mental health disparities and improve overall population mental health. ==== Gender ==== Epidemiological studies have consistently found that women experience more mental health disorders compared to men. Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and eating disorders are among the mental health disorders women experience at a higher frequency than men. The American Psychiatric Association attributes some of these to higher social risk factors. Women experience more poverty compared to men, they are more likely to be victims of violence, and they earn less income than men. === The Stress-Vulnerability Model === The Stress-Vulnerability Model explains the development and progression of mental health disorders as a result of an interaction between an individual's biological or psychological vulnerabilities and external stressors. Vulnerabilities can include genetic predispositions, neurobiological abnormalities, or personality traits, while stressors refer to environmental and social factors such as trauma, poverty, discrimination, or interpersonal conflict.

In social psychiatry, the Stress-Vulnerability Model provides a framework for understanding how social and environmental factors contribute to mental illness. This perspective shifts the focus from purely biological causes to the broader social context, recognizing that reducing external stressors and enhancing social support can mitigate mental health risks. === Community-based care and prevention === Social psychiatry advocates for community-based care and preventive measures to address mental health issues, rather than solely relying on traditional hospital-based care. Public policy analyst Gerald Caplan laid the foundation for preventative mental health care in his 1964 book, Principles of Preventative Psychiatry, where he argues that early intervention in community settings can reduce mental illness stigma and promote mental health. By shifting the focus from individual pathology to the social context, community-based care promotes recovery, reduces stigma, and improves overall well-being. Community-based care offers a range of services, including early intervention, crisis intervention, medication management, therapy, and rehabilitation.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_17", "chunk_id": 17, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 102, "end_sentence": 109, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_18", "text": "By shifting the focus from individual pathology to the social context, community-based care promotes recovery, reduces stigma, and improves overall well-being.

By providing accessible and culturally competent care, community-based programs aim to reduce disparities in mental health care and improve outcomes for individuals with mental illness. These programs often involve collaboration between healthcare providers, social workers, educators, and community members to create supportive environments and empower individuals to build resilience. === Cultural norms, values, and beliefs === Social psychiatry acknowledges that cultural norms, values, and beliefs shape the expression, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses. This perspective advocates for culturally competent care to adjust for biases in psychiatry and public health services. In this sense, social psychiatry mirrors cultural psychiatry by emphasizing how mental illnesses and psychiatric disorders vary across cultural contexts.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_18", "chunk_id": 18, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 108, "end_sentence": 115, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_19", "text": "This perspective advocates for culturally competent care to adjust for biases in psychiatry and public health services.

Cultural psychiatry outlines how different cultures view mental health differently and how that impacts people from seeking help. === Social network and social support theories === Social psychiatry believes that social networks, support, and communities positively influence mental health and wellbeing. Leveraging social network theory and social support models, it emphasizes the importance of fostering strong social ties and support systems to increase resilience and wellbeing. The field focuses on the negative effects of social isolation, as well, arguing that social isolation is a key contributor to mental illnesses. This phenomenon, social psychiatrists argue, is closely tied to poverty and urbanization. == Research == Social psychiatry integrates different social factors of mental health to advocate for systemic changes, such as improving living conditions, addressing discrimination, and ensuring equitable access to mental health care.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_19", "chunk_id": 19, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 114, "end_sentence": 121, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_2", "text": "At this time in Germany, social psychiatry emphasized protection of the general public of those who are mentally ill and 'antisocial.' ==== United States mental health community movement ==== The mental hygiene movement in the United States marked a shift from individual responsibility of mental health to how public health and society could promote mental health. In 1909, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now called Mental Health America) was created to focus on mental illness prevention and mental health promotion. In 1915, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene administered a series of social surveys that explored mental illness outside of asylums and institutions. These surveys uncovered the extent of mental health challenges in society, and led to the development of community-based mental hygiene clinics. A psychiatrist, social workers, and a psychologist staffed these clinics, and provided outpatient services and public health and educational initiatives to prevent mental illness. This would later become a key component of the mental health community movement, which influenced the deinstitutionalization era. === 1930s-1940s === Prior to World War II, the majority of research related to social psychiatry focused on the impact of urbanization on serious psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. One of the first social psychiatric studies, 'Mental Disorders in Urban Areas: An Ecological Study of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses', challenged this focus.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_2", "chunk_id": 2, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 12, "end_sentence": 19, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_20", "text": "This phenomenon, social psychiatrists argue, is closely tied to poverty and urbanization. == Research == Social psychiatry integrates different social factors of mental health to advocate for systemic changes, such as improving living conditions, addressing discrimination, and ensuring equitable access to mental health care.

This involves studying the patterns of mental illness within populations, including prevalence and incidence rates. Researchers often analyze risk factors and protective factors associated with mental disorders. === Life events research === Life events research investigates how significant life events, such as loss, trauma, or major life transitions, can impact mental health.

It explored the relationship between social class and mental illness in New Haven, Connecticut, focusing on disparities in access to and types of mental health care. Using a classification system that divided participants into five social classes, Hollingshead and Redlich analyzed patterns of mental illness diagnoses, treatment settings, and care quality. They found that individuals in lower social classes experienced higher rates of mental illness but were more likely to receive custodial care, while those in upper classes accessed psychotherapy and higher-quality treatments. By highlighting the systemic inequities in mental health care based on social class, this study contributed to social psychiatry by emphasizing the need for equitable mental health services and policy reform to reduce inequities in psychiatric care. ==== Midtown Manhattan study (1962) ==== Mental Health in the Metropolis, published in 1962, was one of the earliest urban studies to systematically document the social factors of mental health.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_23", "chunk_id": 23, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 138, "end_sentence": 145, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_24", "text": "By highlighting the systemic inequities in mental health care based on social class, this study contributed to social psychiatry by emphasizing the need for equitable mental health services and policy reform to reduce inequities in psychiatric care. ==== Midtown Manhattan study (1962) ==== Mental Health in the Metropolis, published in 1962, was one of the earliest urban studies to systematically document the social factors of mental health. The study, conducted by two sociologists, one anthropologist, and two psychiatrists, explored the prevalence of mental disorders in urban Midtown Manhattan. This study provided critical evidence of how urban environments impact mental well-being, and emphasized the significance of cultural diversity and social stressors in shaping mental health. It highlighted that social factors like poverty were more influential to mental health compared to simply living in urban environments. ==== Leighton and Murphy's Stirling County study (1948 - present) ==== The Stirling County Study is a longitudinal investigation investigating the social determinants of mental illness in a rural Canadian community.

In 1946, the United States passed the National Mental Health Act, citing the declining mental health of veterans during World War II. This act provided federal funding for prevention and treatment of mental illness. A direct result of this act was the creation of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1949. NMIH was formed to shift care from psychiatric hospitals to community-based services. === 1950s-1960s === As the community mental health movement gained traction, President John F Kennedy passed the Community Mental Health Act in 1963, which provided $2.9 billion to build community mental health centers across the country.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_4", "chunk_id": 4, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 24, "end_sentence": 31, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_5", "text": "NMIH was formed to shift care from psychiatric hospitals to community-based services. === 1950s-1960s === As the community mental health movement gained traction, President John F Kennedy passed the Community Mental Health Act in 1963, which provided $2.9 billion to build community mental health centers across the country.

In addition, America's involvement in the Vietnam War pulled attention away from domestic affairs and reallocated social welfare spending to war efforts. The 1960s marked several movements that questioned mainstream psychiatry, which social psychiatry had become part of as a result of the policy enacted from its research.

These advancements in neurology, psychopharmacology, and genetics fueled the rise of pharmacological drugs like Prozac, for mental disorders and deemphasized the need for psychotherapy. By the 1980s, biological psychiatry had overtaken social psychiatry as the premier mode of research in mental illness. == Core theories and concepts == Social psychiatry emphasizes how social, cultural, and environmental factors influence mental health and illness. It focuses on understanding and addressing the social determinants of mental health, the role of relationships and community in psychological well-being, and the prevention and treatment of mental disorders within broader social contexts. === Psychobiology === Psychobiology, a term first coined by Adolf Meyer in the early 20th century, refers to an interdisciplinary approach to understanding behavior and mental health by integrating biological, psychological, and social factors.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_7", "chunk_id": 7, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 42, "end_sentence": 49, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_8", "text": "It focuses on understanding and addressing the social determinants of mental health, the role of relationships and community in psychological well-being, and the prevention and treatment of mental disorders within broader social contexts. === Psychobiology === Psychobiology, a term first coined by Adolf Meyer in the early 20th century, refers to an interdisciplinary approach to understanding behavior and mental health by integrating biological, psychological, and social factors. Meyer, often considered the father of modern American psychiatry, advocated for a holistic perspective that examined the interplay between an individual's biological constitution, psychological experiences, and social environment. This approach was unique because it diverged from models that focused exclusively on either biological or psychodynamic explanations for mental illness.

In his book The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry (1955), Sullivan argued that psychiatric disorders are best understood through interpersonal interactions, not just internal conflicts. By integrating social and cultural influences with biological and intra-psychic models, Sullivan believed it was crucial to examine societal structures and interpersonal systems in order to address mental health challenges. Sullivan proposed that personality develops through relationships and that disruptions in these interactions often underlie psychological distress. He introduced the idea that the \"self\" is shaped by social experiences and outlined a developmental framework linking psychological well-being to navigating interpersonal challenges at different life stages, such as trust in infancy and intimacy in adolescence.", "metadata": {"pageid": "2148933", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2148933", "title": "Social psychiatry", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "2148933_chunk_9", "chunk_id": 9, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 54, "end_sentence": 61, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\2148933.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "2537522_chunk_0", "text": "A biologist is a scientist who conducts research in biology.

Robert Hooke, an English natural philosopher, coined the term cell, suggesting plant structure's resemblance to honeycomb cells. Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace independently formulated the theory of evolution by natural selection, which was described in detail in Darwin's book On the Origin of Species, which was published in 1859. In it, Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes of descent with accumulated modification leading to divergence over long periods of time.

Paleontologists reconstruct ancient organisms, ecosystems, and environments; investigate patterns of evolution, extinction, and biodiversity through deep time; and analyze how geological processes influence the preservation and distribution of fossils. Many specialize in particular groups, such as vertebrates, invertebrates, or plants, or in subfields such as taphonomy (the study of fossilization), paleoecology (ancient ecosystems), or biostratigraphy (dating and correlating rock layers using fossils).

This approximation has been used to estimate the force between two charged colloidal particles as shown in the first figure of this article. The exponential nature of these repulsive forces and the fact that its range is given by the Debye length was confirmed experimentally by direct force measurements, including surface forces apparatus, colloidal probe technique, or optical tweezers.

One important conclusion from these studies is that there is an additional attractive electrostatic contribution, which also decays exponentially.

Three-body forces: The interactions between weakly charged objects are pair-wise additive due to the linear nature of the DH approximation. On the PB level, however, attractive three-body forces are present.

Despite the initial criticism, accumulative evidence suggest that the DLVO fails to account for essential physics necessary to describe the experimental observations. While the community remains skeptical regarding the existence of effective attractions between like-charged species, recent computer molecular dynamics simulations with an explicit description of the solvent have demonstrated that the solvent plays an important role in the structure of charged species in solution, while PB and the primitive model do not account for most of these effects.

Alternative derivation of the same relation for disjoining pressure involves the stress tensor. == Debye-H\u00fcckel model == When the electric potentials or charge densities are not too high, the PB equation can be simplified to the Debye-H\u00fcckel (DH) equation. By expanding the exponential function in the PB equation into a Taylor series, one obtains d 2 \u03c8 d z 2 = \u03ba 2 \u03c8 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {d^{2}\\psi }{dz^{2}}}=\\kappa ^{2}\\psi } where \u03ba 2 = 2 \u03b2 q 2 c B \u03b5 0 \u03b5 {\\displaystyle \\;\\;\\;\\kappa ^{2}={\\frac {2\\beta q^{2}c_{\\rm {B}}}{\\epsilon _{0}\\epsilon }}} The parameter \u03ba\u22121 is referred to as the Debye length, and some representative values for a monovalent salt in water at 25\u00b0C with \u03b5 \u2243 80 are given in the table on the right.", "metadata": {"pageid": "37732235", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=37732235", "title": "Double layer forces", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "37732235_chunk_4", "chunk_id": 4, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 24, "end_sentence": 31, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\37732235.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "37732235_chunk_5", "text": "== Debye-H\u00fcckel model == When the electric potentials or charge densities are not too high, the PB equation can be simplified to the Debye-H\u00fcckel (DH) equation.

This approximation thus suggests that one can simply add (superpose) the potentials profiles originating from each surface as illustrated the figure. Since the potential profile passes through a minimum at the mid-plane, it is easiest to evaluate the disjoining pressure at the midplane. The solution of the DH equation for an isolated wall reads \u03c8 ( z ) = \u03c8 D e \u2212 \u03ba z {\\displaystyle \\psi (z)=\\psi _{\\rm {D}}e^{-\\kappa z}} where z is the distance from the surface and \u03c8D the surface potential.

Due to the screening by the electrolyte, the range of the force is given by the Debye length and its strength by the surface potential (or surface charge density). This approximation turns out to be exact provided the plate-plate separation is large compared to the Debye length and the surface potentials are low. This result can be simply generalized to highly charged surfaces, but only at larger separations. Even if the potential is large close to the surface, it will be small at larger distances, and can be described by the DH equation. However, in this case one has to replace the actual diffuse layer potential \u03c8D with the effective potential \u03c8eff.

Microfluidics has been used for cell biology studies as the dimensions of the microfluidic channels are well suited for the physical scale of cells (in the order of magnitude of 10 micrometers). For example, eukaryotic cells have linear dimensions between 10 and 100 \u03bcm which falls within the range of microfluidic dimensions.

There are three conventional approaches to incorporate cell signaling in in vitro cell culture: conditioned media transfer, mixed (or direct) co-culture, and segregated (or indirect) co-culture. The use of conditioned media, where the cultured medium of one cell type (the effector) is introduced to the culture of another cell type (the responder), is a traditional way to include the effects of soluble factors in cell signaling.

Recently, co-culture has become the predominant approach to study the effect of cellular communication by culturing two biologically related cell types together. Mixed co-culture is the simplest co-culture method, where two types of cells are in direct contact within a single culture compartment at the desired cell ratio. Cells can communicate by paracrine and juxtacrine signaling, but separated treatments and downstream analysis of a single cell type are not readily feasible due to the completely mixed population of cells.", "metadata": {"pageid": "50311973", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=50311973", "title": "Microfluidic cell culture", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "50311973_chunk_11", "chunk_id": 11, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 66, "end_sentence": 73, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\50311973.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "50311973_chunk_12", "text": "Mixed co-culture is the simplest co-culture method, where two types of cells are in direct contact within a single culture compartment at the desired cell ratio.

The more common method is segregated co-culture, where the two cell types are physically separated but can communicate in shared media by paracrine signaling. The physical barrier can be a porous membrane, a solid wall, or a hydrogel divider. If the physical barrier is removable (such as in PDMS or hydrogel), the assay can also be used to study cell invasion or cell migration. Co-culture designs can be adapted to tri- or multi-culture, which are often more representative of in vivo conditions relative to co-culture. === Closed channel multi-culture systems === The flexibility of microfluidic devices greatly contributes to the development of multi-culture studies by improved control over spatial patterns.

Two types of cells are co-encapsulated in droplets by combining two streams of cell-laden agarose solutions. After gelation, the agarose microgels will serve as a 3D microenvironment for cell co-culture. Segregated co-culture is also realized in microfluidic channels to study paracrine signaling.

If juxtacrine signaling is to be investigated solely without paracrine signaling, a single cell coupling co-culture microfluidic array can be designed based on a cellular valving principle. === Open channel multi-culture systems === Although closed channel microfluidics (discussed in the section above) offers high customizability and biological complexity for multi-culture, the operation often requires handling expertise and specialized equipment, such as pumps and valves. In addition, the use of PDMS is known to cause adverse effects to cell culture, including leaching of oligomers or absorption of small molecules, thus often doubted by biologists.

Being able to provide different environments in a steady, sustainable and precise manner has a significant impact on cell culture research and study. Those environmental factors include physical (shear stress), biochemical (cell-cell interactions, cell-molecule interactions, cell-substrate interactions), and physicochemical (pH, CO2, temperature, O2) factors. === Oxygen concentration control === Oxygen plays an essential role in biological systems.

However, the PDMS may be problematic for the adsorption of small hydrophobic species. Poly(methyl pentene) (PMP) may be an alternative material, because it has high oxygen permeability and biocompatibility like PDMS. In addition to the challenges of controlling gas concentration, monitoring oxygen in the microfluidic system is another challenge to address.

However, it is hard to control high-resolution temperature in traditional cell culture systems; whereas, microfluidic systems are proven to successfully reach the desired temperature under different temperature conditions through several techniques. For example, the temperature gradient in the microfluidic system can be achieved by mixing two or more inputs at different temperatures and flow rates, and the temperature is measured in the outlet channels by embedding polymer-based aquarium thermocouples. Also, by installing heaters and digital temperature sensors at the base of the microfluidic system, it has been demonstrated that a microfluidic cell culture system can continuously operate for at least 500 hours. The circulating water channels in the microfluidic system are also used to precisely control temperatures of the cell culture channels and chambers.

Cell's health is defined as the collective equilibrium activities of essential and specialized cellular processes; while a cell stressor is defined as a stimulus that causes excursion from its equilibrium state.

A reduced cell population can also be used in a microscale system (e.g., a few hundred cells) in comparison to macroscale culture systems (which often require 105 \u2013 107 cells); this can make studying certain cell-cell interactions more accessible. These reduced cell numbers make studying non-dividing or slow dividing cells (e.g., stem cells) easier than traditional culture methods (e.g., flasks, petri dishes, or well plates) due to the smaller sample volumes.

This technique has demonstrated a stark difference in the sensitivity of the peripheral terminals compared to the neuronal cell body to certain stimuli such as protons. This gives an excellent example as to why it is so important to study the peripheral terminals in isolation using microfluidic cell culture devices. == Culture platforms == === Traditional cell culture === Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture is cell culture that takes place on a flat surface, e.g. the bottom of a well-plate, and is known as the conventional method.

To address this issue many methods have been developed to create a three-dimensional (3D) native cell environment. One example of a 3D method is the hanging drop, where a droplet with growing cells is suspended and hangs downwards, which allows cells to grow around and atop of one another, forming a spheroid. The hanging drop method has been used to culture tumor cells but is limited to the geometry of a sphere. Since the advent of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device fabrication through soft lithography microfluidic devices have progressed and have proven to be very beneficial for mimicking a natural 3D environment for cell culture. === Microfluidic cell culture === Microfluidic devices make possible the study of a single cell to a few hundred cells in a 3D environment.

In 2023, only around 1% of worldwide smartphone ownership were foldable smartphones. == History == In 2006, Polymer Vision showed a roll-able concept and a foldable smartphone, the Readius (zh), at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) which also serves as a reader. In 2008, Nokia presented animated concepts of a flexible device it dubbed \"Morph\", which had a tri-fold design that could be bended into various forms, such as a large unfolded device, a feature phone-sized unit, and a smart wristband. In a 2019 retrospective on the concept, CNET noted that Morph could be considered a forerunner to the first wave of commercially produced folding phones, as well as a showcase of future possibilities. In 2011, Kyocera released a dual-touchscreen Android smartphone known as the Echo, which featured a pair of 3.5-inch touchscreens.", "metadata": {"pageid": "60119704", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=60119704", "title": "Foldable smartphone", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "60119704_chunk_1", "chunk_id": 1, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 6, "end_sentence": 13, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\60119704.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "60119704_chunk_10", "text": "The device can be used with a case that has a kickstand, and a foldable keyboard with a built in trackpad to provide a desktop PC-like experience.

Plastic displays are naturally capable of sustaining the required bend radius for a foldable smartphone, but they are more susceptible to blemishes and scratches than traditional glass smartphone displays. Although Corning does produce a flexible glass product known as Willow Glass, the company states that its manufacturing process requires use of a salt solution\u2014thus making it unsuitable for electronic displays because the salt can damage the transistors used in OLED panels (which are built directly on the panel). Nonetheless, the company stated in March 2019 that it was in the process of developing a flexible glass suitable for smartphones, which would be 1 mm (0.039 in) thick and have a 5 mm (0.20 in) bend radius. Samsung marketed its Galaxy Z Flip as featuring 30 \u03bcm (0.0012 in)-thick \"ultra-thin glass\" with a plastic layer similar to the Galaxy Fold, manufactured by Samsung with materials from Schott AG, which is \"produced using an intensifying process to enhance its flexibility and durability\", and injected with a \"special material up to an undisclosed depth to achieve a consistent hardness\".

The development of thin, flexible OLED displays enabled the possibility for new designs and form factors. During its Consumer Electronics Show keynote in 2013, Samsung presented several concepts\u2014codenamed Youm - for smartphones incorporating flexible displays. One such concept was a smartphone that could fold outward into a single, uninterrupted tablet-sized display. The first Youm concept to make it to a production model was the Galaxy Note Edge\u2014a phablet with a portion of the screen that sloped over the right-hand bezel.

In November 2018, the Chinese startup Royole released the first commercially available foldable smartphone with an OLED display, the Royole Flexpai.

One early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to \"skill\" or \"craft\", as associated with words such as \"artisan\". English words derived from this meaning include artifact, artificial, artifice, medical arts, and military arts. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its etymology. Over time, philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Immanuel Kant, among others, questioned the meaning of art.

For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. In Byzantine and Medieval art of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe. Renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space. In the east, Islamic art's rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns, calligraphy, and architecture. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too.

Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones. In The Origin of the Work of Art, Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher and seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which \"that which is\" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding.

Extreme Intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded. It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented, and the content as the artist's experience of that subject. For example, the composition of Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne is partly borrowed from the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. As evidenced by the title, the subject is Napoleon, and the content is Ingres's representation of Napoleon as \"Emperor-God beyond time and space\". Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant.", "metadata": {"pageid": "752", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752", "title": "Art", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "752_chunk_17", "chunk_id": 17, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 102, "end_sentence": 109, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\752.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "752_chunk_18", "text": "As evidenced by the title, the subject is Napoleon, and the content is Ingres's representation of Napoleon as \"Emperor-God beyond time and space\". Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is \"socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise\". Finally, the developing theory of post-structuralism studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work. The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography.

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes. A common view is that the epithet art, particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two.

The dialogue Ion suggests that Homer's Iliad functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted. With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, Dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.

The creation of a piece can be affected by factors such as the artist's mood, surroundings, and mental state. For example, The Black Paintings by Francisco de Goya, created in the elder years of his life, are thought to be so bleak because he was in isolation and because of his experience with war.

According to education journals, the reflection of art is considered an essential part of the experience. However an important aspect of art is that others may view and appreciate it as well.

Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society. Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood.

Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the Palace of Versailles, where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside. Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the Orleans Collection mostly housed in a wing of the Palais Royal in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible.

The opening of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre during the French Revolution (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established. Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. However, museums do not only provide availability to art, but do also influence the way art is being perceived by the audience, as studies found. Thus, the museum itself is not only a blunt stage for the presentation of art, but plays an active and vital role in the overall perception of art in modern society.

But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status. There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is \"necessary to present something more than mere objects\" said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as performance art, video art, and conceptual art. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was an idea, it could not be bought and sold. \"Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s.", "metadata": {"pageid": "752", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752", "title": "Art", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "752_chunk_41", "chunk_id": 41, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 246, "end_sentence": 253, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\752.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "752_chunk_42", "text": "The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was an idea, it could not be bought and sold. \"Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object.\" In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works, invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art.

This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art. The aesthetic theorist John Ruskin, who championed what he saw as the naturalism of J. M. W. Turner, saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.", "metadata": {"pageid": "752", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752", "title": "Art", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "752_chunk_46", "chunk_id": 46, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 276, "end_sentence": 283, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\752.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "752_chunk_47", "text": "W.

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. Richard Wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the Realist, whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the Objectivist, whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the Relativist position, whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans. === Arrival of Modernism === The arrival of Modernism in the late 19th century led to a radical break in the conception of the function of art, and then again in the late 20th century with the advent of postmodernism. Clement Greenberg's 1960 article \"Modernist Painting\" defines modern art as \"the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself\". Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting: Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting\u2014the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment\u2014were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly.", "metadata": {"pageid": "752", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752", "title": "Art", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "752_chunk_47", "chunk_id": 47, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 282, "end_sentence": 289, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\752.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "752_chunk_48", "text": "Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting: Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art.

Clark, Rosalind Krauss, Linda Nochlin and Griselda Pollock among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.

Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions.

Techne included painting, sculpting and music, but also cooking, medicine, horsemanship, geometry, carpentry, prophecy, and farming, etc. === New Criticism and the \"intentional fallacy\" === Following Duchamp during the first half of the 20th century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.", "metadata": {"pageid": "752", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752", "title": "Art", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "752_chunk_50", "chunk_id": 50, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 300, "end_sentence": 307, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\752.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "752_chunk_51", "text": "This resulted in the rise of the New Criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy.

In 1946, William K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled \"The Intentional Fallacy\", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention, or \"intended meaning\" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting. In another essay, \"The Affective Fallacy\", which served as a kind of sister essay to \"The Intentional Fallacy\" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader-response school of literary theory.

As summarized by Berys Gaut and Paisley Livingston in their essay \"The Creation of Art\": \"Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms' assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic.\" These authors contend that: \"Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work.\" Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: \"Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works.\" They quote Richard Wollheim as stating that, \"The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself.\" === \"Linguistic turn\" and its debate === The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the \"innocent eye debate\" in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art. Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the structuralism of Ferdinand de Saussure and the ensuing movement of poststructuralism.

Influential theorists include Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by Hayden White. The fact that language is not a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of philosophy of language which originated in the works of Johann Georg Hamann and Wilhelm von Humboldt. Ernst Gombrich and Nelson Goodman in his book Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.

Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, \"the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life\" are \"so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art.\" According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the Daily Mail criticized Hirst's and Emin's work by arguing \"For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all\" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work. In 1998, Arthur Danto, suggested a thought experiment showing that \"the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood.\" Anti-art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art; it is a term associated with Dadaism and attributed to Marcel Duchamp just before World War I, when he was making art from found objects.

Anti-art is a feature of work by Situationist International, the lo-fi Mail art movement, and the Young British Artists, though it is a form still rejected by the Stuckists, who describe themselves as anti-anti-art. Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example. === Value judgment === Somewhat in relation to the above, the word art is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as \"that meal was a work of art\" (the cook is an artist), or \"the art of deception\" (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive.", "metadata": {"pageid": "752", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752", "title": "Art", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "752_chunk_56", "chunk_id": 56, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 336, "end_sentence": 343, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\752.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "752_chunk_57", "text": "Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism.

Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, \"good\" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, Francisco Goya's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3 May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage.", "metadata": {"pageid": "752", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752", "title": "Art", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "752_chunk_57", "chunk_id": 57, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 342, "end_sentence": 349, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\752.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "752_chunk_58", "text": "For example, Francisco Goya's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3 May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians.

Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'. The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist.

On 5 March 2015, the Islamic State (IS) reportedly started the demolition of Nimrud, an Assyrian city from the 13th century BC. The local palace was bulldozed, while lamassu statues at the gates of the palace of Ashurnasirpal II were smashed. A video showing the destruction of Nimrud was released in April 2015.

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as Inca, Maya, and Olmec. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.", "metadata": {"pageid": "752", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=752", "title": "Art", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "752_chunk_9", "chunk_id": 9, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 54, "end_sentence": 61, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\752.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "76197486_chunk_0", "text": "Shockwave cosmology is a non-standard cosmology proposed by Joel Smoller and Blake Temple in 2003.

At some point, the event horizon of the black hole will cease to be. An outside observer will then see it appear as a white hole.

Both passionate and companionate love can contribute to relationship satisfaction. Passionate and companionate love can also be further distinguished from a third important type of love, compassionate love, which is love focused on caring about others.

John Bowlby's original concept of an \"attachment system\" referred to a system evolved to keep infants in proximity of their caregiver (or \"attachment figure\"). The person uses the attachment figure as a \"secure base\" to feel safe exploring the environment, seeks proximity with the attachment figure when threatened, and suffers distress when separated.

However, companionate love has also been characterized as being more like strong friendship, and Ellen Berscheid suggests that it's unproven whether all adult relationships are attachments in the sense meant by attachment theory. Berscheid writes that the assumption that romantic partners are each other's attachment figures is \"in dire need of empirical scrutiny.\" == Timeline == While passionate love is sometimes associated with the phenomenon of love at first sight, not everyone falls in love quickly or suddenly. In one study of Chinese and American participants, 38% fell in love fast and 35% fell in love slowly, and in another study of Iranians, 70% fell in love slowly or very slowly. A popular hypothesis suggests that passionate love turns into companionate love over time in a relationship, but other accounts suggest that while companionate love takes longer to develop, it is important at the beginning of a relationship as well.

Another estimate comes from a 1999 experiment performed by Donatelli Marazziti and colleagues which found a difference in blood serotonin levels between newly in love people and controls, and found these levels had returned to normal after 12 to 18 months. Intense attraction can also last much longer in rarer cases, as in the phenomenon of long-term intense romantic love. These lovers tend to show lower levels of obsession than in the early stage, however.

Companionate love generally increases with liking and familiarity, but the circumstances surrounding passionate love are more complicated. Studies show that love and conflict can sit side-by-side in a relationship, and passionate love in particular is even said to be amplified by negative emotions. === Liking === According to Ellen Berscheid, companionate love \"follows the pleasure-pain principle; we like those who reward us and dislike those who punish us.\" Examples of factors include similarity, familiarity, expressions of self-esteem and validation one's self-worth, physical attraction and mutual self-disclosures. Also, while passionate love is often said to come before companionate love, Berscheid suggests that companionate love can also be a component in the development of passionate love.", "metadata": {"pageid": "77014591", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=77014591", "title": "Passionate and companionate love", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_14", "chunk_id": 14, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 84, "end_sentence": 91, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\77014591.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_15", "text": "=== Liking === According to Ellen Berscheid, companionate love \"follows the pleasure-pain principle; we like those who reward us and dislike those who punish us.\" Examples of factors include similarity, familiarity, expressions of self-esteem and validation one's self-worth, physical attraction and mutual self-disclosures. Also, while passionate love is often said to come before companionate love, Berscheid suggests that companionate love can also be a component in the development of passionate love. === Sexual desire === Authors disagree on the role sexual desire plays in the development of romantic love. Passionate love is often associated with sexual desire, for example Ellen Berscheid suggests that one possible account of passionate love is \"a felicitous combination of companionate love and sexual desire.\" However, Lisa Diamond has suggested that while sexual desire is often a causal component, passionate love can occur outside the context of sexual desire. Diamond's argument rests on various reports and historical accounts, as well as an evolutionary argument that the brain systems underlying romantic love evolved independent of sexual orientation. Diamond thinks that time spent together and physical touch can act as a \"stand-in\" for sexual desire and facilitate romantic love between partners regardless of their sexual orientation. Helen Fisher has argued that passionate love is related to the phenomenon of mammalian courtship attraction, or mate choice, and that people have certain preferences for choosing a preferred mating partner that determines who they fall in love with. However, Fisher argues this type of attraction is distinct from the sex drive, although they are interrelated.", "metadata": {"pageid": "77014591", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=77014591", "title": "Passionate and companionate love", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_15", "chunk_id": 15, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 90, "end_sentence": 97, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\77014591.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_16", "text": "Helen Fisher has argued that passionate love is related to the phenomenon of mammalian courtship attraction, or mate choice, and that people have certain preferences for choosing a preferred mating partner that determines who they fall in love with.

Surprise and uncertainty tend to be more of a characteristic of new relationships because more established partners tend to behave as expected, thus rarely generating this sort of arousal. Helen Fisher recommends doing novel and exciting things together to ignite passion. In an experiment by Arthur Aron & Christina Norman, couples doing an exciting task (as opposed to a boring one) experienced increased feelings of relationship satisfaction and romantic love. Elaine Hatfield has even suggested that negative or mixed emotions can amplify feelings of passionate love. In A New Look at Love, she writes \"Passion demands physical arousal and unpleasant experiences are just as arousing as pleasant ones.\" Hatfield cites animal studies, such as one study in which puppies that were inconsistently either rewarded or maltreated were the most attracted to and dependent on their trainer.", "metadata": {"pageid": "77014591", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=77014591", "title": "Passionate and companionate love", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_16", "chunk_id": 16, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 96, "end_sentence": 103, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\77014591.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_17", "text": "Elaine Hatfield has even suggested that negative or mixed emotions can amplify feelings of passionate love.

People who behave consistently generate little emotion, she says, and \"What would generate a spark of interest, however, is if our admiring friend suddenly started treating us with contempt\u2014or if our arch enemy started inundating us with kindness.\" === Intimacy === Another theory is that passion occurs when a rapid increase in intimacy occurs. A similar theory, by Arthur Aron & Elaine Aron, states that passion occurs in the context of a rapid self-expansion of the self and the inclusion of the qualities of the beloved into one's self-concept. With both of these theories, it's predicted that passion wanes in a relationship as partners get to know each other and the increase in intimacy tends to stabilize. === Love regulation === Love regulation is \"the use of behavioral or cognitive strategies to change the intensity of current feelings of romantic love.\" In some cases, love feelings may be stronger than desired such as after a breakup, or love feelings may be weaker than desired such as when they decline throughout a long-term relationship. Sandra Langeslag notes that it's a common misconception that love feelings are uncontrollable, or even should not be controlled; however studies have shown that love regulation is possible and may be useful. For example, looking at pictures of the beloved has been shown to increase feelings of infatuation (i.e.", "metadata": {"pageid": "77014591", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=77014591", "title": "Passionate and companionate love", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_17", "chunk_id": 17, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 102, "end_sentence": 109, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\77014591.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_18", "text": "Sandra Langeslag notes that it's a common misconception that love feelings are uncontrollable, or even should not be controlled; however studies have shown that love regulation is possible and may be useful.

In another technique called cognitive reappraisal, one focuses on positive or negative aspects of the beloved, the relationship, or imagined future scenarios: In negative reappraisal, one focuses on negative qualities of the beloved (\"he's lazy\", \"she's always late\"), the relationship (\"we fight a lot\") or imagined future scenarios (\"he'll cheat on me\"). Negative reappraisal decreases feelings of infatuation and attachment, but decreases mood in the short term. Langeslag has recommended distraction as an antidote to the short-term decrease in mood.

Positive reappraisal increases attachment and can increase relationship satisfaction, which could, for example, help stabilize a long-term relationship. Love regulation does not switch feelings on or off immediately, so Langeslag recommends, for example, writing a list of things once a day to feel a lasting change. == Biology == Passionate and companionate love are thought to be interrelated but involve different brain systems and serve different purposes.

A 2014 study of Iranian young adults found that the early stage of romantic love was associated with the brighter side of hypomania (elation, mental and physical activity, and positive social interaction) and better sleep quality, but also stronger symptoms of depression and anxiety. The authors conclude that romantic love is \"not entirely a joyful and happy period of life\". Passionate love is said to usually only be present (or the most intense) in the early stage of love, when a relationship is new or before a relationship has started.

Passionate love is sometimes compared to addiction, although there are differences.

The PLS also measures an obsessional element which is distinguishable in that it's possible to experience love feelings (and even intense attraction) with lower levels of obsession. Finally, while Elaine Hatfield originally described passionate love as having a component of sexual attraction, contemporary authors generally agree that sexual attraction and romantic attraction are distinct. People are motivated to initiate and maintain a pair bond in a way that's different from the sex drive, and it is possible to fall in love in the absence of sexual desire. === Infatuation === Langeslag et al.'s Infatuation Scale (analogous to passionate love) has items asking about: Staring into the distance while thinking of the beloved.

Hatfield suggests that when parents and friends say somebody is \"just infatuated\" they're just saying they don't approve of the relationship. === Obsession === Passionate love is described as having an obsessional element characterized by intrusive thinking, uncertainty, and mood swings. Intrusive thinking (or obsessive thinking) is a component of early-stage romantic love. One study found that on average people in love spent 65% of their waking hours thinking of their loved one.

In Acevedo & Aron's analysis, passionate love with obsession was associated with increased relationship satisfaction only in short-term relationships. Romantic obsession was associated with slightly decreased satisfaction in the long-term. Another meta-analysis by James Graham found a strong association between romantic obsession (using the mania love attitude\u2014similar in concept to the PLS obsession factor described by Acevedo & Aron) and decreased satisfaction over time.

Attachment style refers to differences in attachment-related thoughts and behaviors, especially relating to the concept of security vs. insecurity. This can be split into components of anxiety (worrying the partner is available, attentive and responsive) and avoidance (preference not to rely on others or open up emotionally). It has been suggested that attachment style forms during childhood and adolescence, but twin studies have also suggested a heritable component, and attachment anxiety is correlated with the personality trait neuroticism. People can also have different attachment styles with different partners, for example an avoidant partner can cause a secure partner to feel and act anxious. === Positive illusions === Idealization (perceiving the beloved in the most positive way, or overlooking their faults) is a form of positive illusions. A 1996 study of couples who had been dating for 19 months and couples who had been married for 6.5 years found that \"Individuals were happier in their relationships when they idealized their partners and their partners idealized them.\" A brain scan experiment also found that couples who were still in love after four years (as compared to those who weren't) showed activation in a region associated with suspending negative judgment and over-evaluating a partner.", "metadata": {"pageid": "77014591", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=77014591", "title": "Passionate and companionate love", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_8", "chunk_id": 8, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 48, "end_sentence": 55, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\77014591.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "77014591_chunk_9", "text": "=== Positive illusions === Idealization (perceiving the beloved in the most positive way, or overlooking their faults) is a form of positive illusions.

While Elaine Hatfield and others have traditionally associated idealization with passionate love, studies on positive illusions have looked at couples in varied stages of their relationships, including long-term couples. == Companionate love == Companionate love is said to be felt less intensely than passionate love, consisting more of gentle affection which is felt when things are going well. Elaine Hatfield writes that companionate love is \"a steady burning fire, fueled by delightful experiences but extinguished by painful ones\" Companionate love is more about long-term relationships, and Hatfield emphasizes partner compatibility as being important. Ellen Berscheid comments that companionate love \"may be the 'staff of life' for many relationships and a better basis for a satisfying marriage than romantic love.\" Companionate love is linked to intimacy and Hatfield suggests that intimate relationships have these characteristics: Companionate love is usually considered the same as storge, although James Graham has argued on the basis of a meta-analytic factor analysis that the storge love attitude most corresponds to practical friendship which lacks qualities of companionate love (such as intimacy and commitment). === Attachment === Langeslag et al.'s Attachment Scale (analogous to companionate love) has items asking about: Feeling that one can count on the beloved.

Falling water generates static electricity either by collisions between water drops or with the ground, leading to the finer mist in updrafts being mainly negatively charged, with positive near the lower surface.

There can also be contributions from contact potential differences between liquids or gases and other materials, similar to the work function differences for solids. It has been suggested that a triboelectric series for liquids is useful. One difference from solids is that often liquids have charged double layers, and most of the work to date supports that ion transfer (rather than electron) dominates for liquids as first suggested by Irving Langmuir in 1938.

Similar to the collisions between other types of particles mentioned above, the ice particles become positively charged and the graupel negative. The two have different densities, with the ice particles tending to rise and the graupel fall or move towards the center of the storm.

The specific process of using corona discharge to produce gaseous negative ions is to connect the high-voltage negative electrode to a thin needle-shaped wire or a conductor with a very small radius of curvature, so that a strong electric field is generated near the electrode, releasing electrons. The electrons to collide with gas molecules, and produce new free electrons and positive ions.

NAI measurement can be achieved by measuring the change in atmospheric conductivity when NAI pass through a conductive tube. NAI identification is typically performed by mass spectrometry, which can effectively identify a variety of negative ions, including O\u2212,O2\u2212,O3\u2212,CO3\u2212,HCO3\u2212,NO3\u2212, etc. == Application of negative air ions == === Environmental improvement === Negative air ions are a component of electrostatic filters which are used to remove dust and particulate pollutants (PM) both in industry and for indoor pollutants.

This information is particularly useful for identifying patients who may benefit from more aggressive treatment strategies. == Characterization == The hypothesis was developed due to several key studies, which have demonstrated the ability of CTC clusters to: Intravasate and travel as clusters: Research has shown that CTC clusters can enter the bloodstream as a group, travel through the circulatory system intact, and maintain their cluster phenotype during transit.

These findings underscore the critical role of CTC clusters in driving the metastatic cascade and suggest that CTC clusters could serve as important biomarkers in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms that allow CTC clusters to retain their structure and survive in circulation opens new avenues for targeted cancer therapies designed to disrupt this process. == Future directions == As research into the cancer exodus hypothesis progresses, new therapeutic strategies could emerge to specifically target CTC clusters.

Historians analyse these developments under late-modern occulture and market logics rather than as extensions of academic psychology proper. ==== New religious movements and diffusion ==== Scholars of new religious movements (NRMs) have noted that several conduits linking esoteric repertoires to popular psychological culture ran through movement contexts\u2014e.g., Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Spiritism and, in late modernity, the heterogeneous networks often labelled \u201cNew Age\u201d (a label related with the esoteric belief in an astrological Age of Aquarius, although not every idea or movement labeled as New Age actually holds this belief).

In this environment, esoteric content was often translated into symbolic-psychological frames (e.g., projective counselling, human potential workshops) or packaged for wellness and coaching, while academic psychology largely followed separate methodological trajectories. Although the New Age as a self-identified movement declined as an organizational label before the end of the 20th century, scholars argue that many of its psychologized practices and narratives dispersed into broader wellness, self-help, and 'spiritual but not religious' cultures where they continue to provide idioms for meaning-making and self-work. == Schools and modalities in psychology, psychotherapy, and counselling == === Analytical psychology (Jung) === Within analytical psychology, Carl Jung developed a sustained hermeneutics of premodern symbol-systems\u2014most prominently alchemy\u2014as resources for theorising psychic structure, transformation and individuation. Techniques such as active imagination, dream work and the use of mandalas exemplified a translation of esoteric repertoires into psychological practice under a symbolic/interpretive framing.

Subsequent developments associated with archetypal psychology started by James Hillman emphasised imaginal and mythopoetic registers for clinical reflection, extending the Jungian repertoire of symbols and narratives while maintaining an interpretive (non-realist) stance toward premodern materials.

While drawing selectively on religious and esoteric vocabularies (e.g., stages, higher/unifying self), psychosynthesis presented these as symbolic devices for integration and meaning-making rather than as doctrinal commitments, and established dedicated training and counselling contexts distinct from Jungian institutions. In workshop and clinical formats, psychosynthesis employed structured sequences (evocation of imagery, reflective processing, value clarification) that align with humanistic and transpersonal milieus in which ritualised settings and symbolic repertoires were redeployed for experiential learning.

Although Reich presented his model as biophysics rather than spirituality, his concept of orgone\u2014a universal life energy said to permeate both psyche and cosmos\u2014echoed older vitalist and mesmerist cosmologies. Scholars such as Christopher Partridge and Egil Asprem interpret Reich\u2019s system as part of the modern afterlife of esoteric vitalism, where notions of subtle energy were reformulated within psychological and quasi-scientific vocabularies. In historiographical perspective, Wouter J. Hanegraaff classifies this type of \u201cbiophysical occultism\u201d under the rubric of \u201crejected knowledge\u201d: claims framed as science but conceptually aligned with esoteric models of energy and self-transformation.

In the postwar period, \u201cneo-Reichian\u201d movements extended these ideas into expressive and group-based psychotherapies that combined breathing, grounding, and cathartic movement. Among them, Alexander Lowen\u2019s bioenergetic analysis, and related body-oriented approaches within the human potential movement integrated performative and affective techniques while recasting them in psychodynamic and secular terms. These modalities demonstrate how vitalist and paraphysical conceptions of body\u2013mind energy migrated from Western esotericism into somatic and transpersonal psychology, bridging the genealogies of dynamic psychiatry and the modern culture of self-regulation. === Transpersonal psychology === Transpersonal psychology systematised mid-twentieth-century developments by theorising non-ordinary states and integrating selected esoteric vocabularies\u2014subtle-body maps, archetypal narratives and ritualised techniques\u2014into psychological models of development, crisis and integration. In practice and training milieus influenced by the Human Potential Movement and venues such as the Esalen Institute, experiential formats (e.g., guided imagery, breathwork, ritualised settings) supplied containers within which symbolic repertoires could be framed for self-exploration and clinical reflection. Within the field\u2019s literature, commentators emphasise both genealogical debts to Western esotericism (e.g., Jungian hermeneutics, occultist codifications of subtle bodies) and the need for source-critical distinctions between symbolic/interpretive framings and realist\u2013occult claims.

In boundary zones adjacent to transpersonal studies, parapsychology continued the nineteenth-century psychical-research agenda in laboratory and survey settings (e.g., studies of telepathy or clairvoyance); in this article such intersections are treated as historical interfaces with psychology rather than as evidential endorsements. In this milieu, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and adjacent \u201cpsychonautics\u201d\u2014most prominently in the early work of Stanislav Grof (e.g., LSD psychotherapy and later holotropic breathwork)\u2014were framed as laboratories for mapping non-ordinary states with archetypal and symbolic vocabularies. Such programmes illustrate the field\u2019s dual emphasis on experiential method and interpretive framing, while reviews at the psychology\u2013religion interface caution to separate genealogical links to esoteric repertoires from evidential claims and to distinguish clinical protocols from neoshamanic or ritual translations. === Anthroposophic clinical and pedagogical therapies === In Anthroposophy, esoteric doctrines were extended into pedagogy and para-clinical practice, associating imagination and development with disciplined movement, colour and form. Under banners such as Eurythmy and arts-based therapeutic work, anthroposophic centres and clinics\u2014organised around hubs like the Goetheanum\u2014framed symbolic movement and creative exercises as instruments for well-being, rehabilitation or education, sometimes alongside subtle-body explanations and sometimes within secular pedagogical vocabularies.

Historians treat the linkage between doctrine, pedagogy and para-clinical arts as a key channel of diffusion from esoteric milieus to psychological language, while maintaining a clear analytic separation between provenance and empirical claims about efficacy or safety. === Hypnosis and brief therapies === From nineteenth-century mesmerism and guided somnambulism to medical hypnosis and later brief, strategic or indirect approaches, trance work provides a through-line connecting esoteric repertoires and psychological technique. What began as claims about invisible \u201cfluids\u201d and mediumistic channels was re-coded in medical and psychological vocabularies as suggestion, attentional focusing and communicative framing; staged demonstrations and clinical case series helped normalise descriptive languages for trance phenomena and dissociation. In contemporary practice, indirect and narrative methods (often associated with Ericksonian influence) treat images, metaphors and ritualised sequences as devices for re-patterning experience without realist\u2013occult commitments. === Neoshamanisms and related practices === Late twentieth-century neoshamanic currents adapted drumming, \u201cjourneying\u201d and small-scale ritual dramaturgy into workshop formats oriented toward self-knowledge, counselling or group learning. In many cases\u2014e.g., the approach popularised by Michael Harner\u2014realist\u2013occult claims were downplayed in favour of symbolic or psychagogic framings, yet the borrowing of esoteric vocabularies and techniques remained evident.", "metadata": {"pageid": "81304225", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=81304225", "title": "Western esotericism and psychology", "section": "Introduction", "chunk_uid": "81304225_chunk_24", "chunk_id": 24, "num_sentences": 8, "start_sentence": 144, "end_sentence": 151, "source_file": "data/cleaned_text_final\\81304225.txt"}}, {"chunk_uid": "81304225_chunk_25", "text": "=== Neoshamanisms and related practices === Late twentieth-century neoshamanic currents adapted drumming, \u201cjourneying\u201d and small-scale ritual dramaturgy into workshop formats oriented toward self-knowledge, counselling or group learning.

An American strand often labelled New Thought\u2014later echoed in formulations such as the law of attraction\u2014provided vocabularies of mental causation and affirmation that were readily repackaged as techniques for self-knowledge, motivation and optimisation. Historians read these idioms within the broader late-modern dynamics of occulture and the cultic milieu, which situate diffusion through publishing, workshops, retreats and media rather than through academic psychology. Early twentieth-century popular psychology also popularised relaxation-through-attention methods. Writers such as Annie Payson Call taught guided relaxation and posture\u2013breath discipline for \u201cnerves\u201d and self-regulation in non-clinical settings, combining moral reform with bodily awareness (see relaxation techniques, guided imagery).

Historian Mark Singleton characterises her method (analytically) as \u201csalvation through relaxation\u201d, and argues that its emphasis on proprioceptive awareness and repose prefigured twentieth-century relaxation therapies and fed into Western receptions of \u201cyoga-like\u201d breath and relaxation practices. In this sense, Call exemplifies how harmonial religion prefigured the modern psychologization of esoteric ideas about inner harmony and divine influx. Historians also note that the \u201cbreath culture\u201d repertoire systematized by William Walker Atkinson (as \u201cYogi Ramacharaka\u201d) drew largely on Western hygienic and psychological currents subsequently reframed in Indic vocabulary; scholarship interprets this as a case of Western re-signification rather than direct transmission from South Asian sources. In parallel, the Mazdaznan movement propagated a \u201creligion of breathing\u201d that blended Theosophical, neo-Zoroastrian and popular psychophysiological motifs, illustrating early esoteric reinterpretations of respiratory discipline within the American harmonial field. Among late-1960s self-help and human potential offerings, Jos\u00e9 Silva\u2019s Silva Method (originally \u201cSilva Mind Control\u201d) packaged relaxation/auto-hypnosis and guided imagery\u2014 including exercises with \u201cinner guides\u201d (imaginal counselors)\u2014together with the era\u2019s alpha-training discourse and New Thought-style autosuggestion, while also invoking elements of ESP in a parapsychological key.

The Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), inspired by Jungian typology, achieved wide uptake in education, management and pastoral guidance despite sustained methodological criticism concerning reliability, temporal stability of \u201ctypes\u201d and predictive validity; overviews recommend caution regarding its use for selection or diagnosis. By contrast, the modern Enneagram took shape in late twentieth-century esoteric\u2013therapeutic milieus (e.g., Oscar Ichazo's system and later adaptations by Claudio Naranjo), before diffusing into counselling and coaching; academic surveys emphasise its recent genealogy, heterogeneous evidence base and cultural vigency rather than established efficacy.

Educational and pastoral counselling contexts also served as diffusion channels: personality typologies (MBTI; the modern Enneagram) and symbolic counselling devices were adopted for guidance and self-exploration, often framed under values education or spiritual accompaniment.

At the edges of popular psychology, ritualised or dramaturgic formats were marketed for personal change.

In this perspective, the grid helps historians describe how symbolic mediations and techniques of transformation were translated into psychological idioms in specific periods and publics, while avoiding essentialist claims. Placed within nineteenth- and twentieth-century contexts, Wouter J. Hanegraaff proposes an etic use of \u201coccultism\u201d for modern currents that explored interfaces between science, comparative religion and esoteric practice, and describes a two-way traffic between religious and psychological languages\u2014\u201cpsychologization of religion\u201d and \u201csacralization of psychology\u201d\u2014to account for the reception of alchemy, astrology and subtle-body maps in theory, therapy and self-work.

Complementarily, long-duration histories of dynamic psychiatry (as theorized by the historiographer of psychiatry Henri Ellenberger) trace continuities from exorcism to mesmerism, hypnosis and the emergence of clinical psychologies, providing a background against which such reframings occurred. Recent work has refined \u201cpsychologization\u201d by distinguishing several modes (e.g., complementary, terminological, reductive, idealist) and by analysing the appeal to a distinct \u201cmagical plane\u201d (a separate-but-connected psychic locus) that insulates ritual practice from empirical critique while aligning it with psychoanalytic or depth-psychological vocabularies.

This intellectual milieu provided a cultural background for later mind-cure and New Thought movements, in which esoteric motifs of correspondence and transformation were increasingly psychologized and reframed as methods of self-regulation and healing. Within the social worlds of spiritualism and early psychical research, clinicians and philosophers used trance cases to theorise divided consciousness. Pierre Janet\u2019s work on dissociation systematised observations of automatisms (automatic writing, trance speech) as expressions of partitioned awareness, while discussions by William James and Sigmund Freud\u2014both attentive to hypnosis and to hysteria debates\u2014helped normalise psychological framings that did not rely on occult fluids or literal spirit agencies. Case-rich monographs such as Th\u00e9odore Flournoy\u2019s study of glossolalia and secondary personalities supplied detailed documentation without doctrinal commitments, furnishing materials for theorising imagination, suggestion and divided consciousness in secular terms.
