Alongside occultist codifications, late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century comparative religion and history of religions projects created interpretive frames for reading premodern symbol-systems (e.g., alchemical, visionary or divinatory corpora) in dialogue with emerging psychological languages. Philological and comparative syntheses furnished taxonomies and narratives that could later be reframed in counselling and self-work, a trajectory consolidated in the 1930s around forums integrating Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions approaches, including figures later associated with the Eranos circle such as Mircea Eliade and Henry Corbin. Within twentieth-century ceremonial magic, Israel Regardie framed Golden Dawn techniques—especially the “Middle Pillar”—as psychological procedures for enhancing or “exalting” consciousness, and published core ritual materials (1937–40), easing their circulation into occulture and self-work milieus. Historiographically, Regardie functions as a case for analysing distinct modes of "psychologization of esotericism" (e.g., terminological and complementary) and the appeal to a “magical plane” that relocates efficacy claims to a psychic register compatible with depth-psychological idioms. Tradition interfaces in this period Theosophy codified subtle-body and chakra maps for Western publics, providing portable visual grammars subsequently re-described in psychological and wellness idioms. Anthroposophy linked esoteric doctrines to pedagogical and para-clinical projects (e.g., Eurythmy), where movement, colour and form were framed as instruments of development and regulation. A concurrent American strand, New Thought, articulated mental-causation vocabularies that later informed self-help and coaching; historians situate this diffusion within late-modern occulture and the psychologization of religion. Institutional and editorial hubs in this period The Theosophical Society and its publishing arms (e.g., Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar) disseminated handbooks and plates of subtle-body/chakra schemes for non-initiatory audiences, while anthroposophic centres around the Goetheanum (Dornach) developed pedagogical and para-clinical programmes that integrated symbolic movement and arts therapies.
