The concentration profiles thus become c ± = c B e ∓ β q ψ {\displaystyle c_{\pm }=c_{\rm {B}}e^{\mp \beta q\psi }} where β = 1/(kT). This relation reflects the Boltzmann distribution of the ions with the energy ±qψ. Inserting these relations into the Poisson equation one obtains the PB equation d 2 ψ d z 2 = q c B ε 0 ε [ e + β q ψ − e − β q ψ ] {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\psi }{dz^{2}}}={\frac {qc_{\rm {B}}}{\epsilon _{0}\epsilon }}[e^{+\beta q\psi }-e^{-\beta q\psi }]} The potential profile between two plates is normally obtained by solving this equation numerically. Once the potential profile is known, the force per unit area between the plates expressed as the disjoining pressure Π can be obtained as follows. The starting point is the Gibbs–Duhem relation for a two component system at constant temperature − V d Π + N + d μ + + N − d μ − = 0 {\displaystyle -Vd\Pi +N_{+}d\mu _{+}+N_{-}d\mu _{-}=0} Introducing the concentrations c± and using the expressions of the chemical potentials μ± given above one finds d Π = k T ( d c + + d c − ) + q ( c + − c − ) d ψ {\displaystyle d\Pi =kT(dc_{+}+dc_{-})+q(c_{+}-c_{-})d\psi } The concentration difference can be eliminated with the Poisson equation and the resulting equation can be integrated from infinite separation of the plates to the actual separation h by realizing that 2 ( d 2 ψ / d z 2 ) d ψ = d ( d ψ / d z ) 2 {\displaystyle 2(d^{2}\psi /dz^{2})d\psi =d(d\psi /dz)^{2}} Expressing the concentration profiles in terms of the potential profiles one obtains Π = k T c B ( e + β q ψ + e − β q ψ − 2 ) − ε 0 ε 2 ( d ψ d z ) 2 {\displaystyle \Pi =kTc_{\rm {B}}(e^{+\beta q\psi }+e^{-\beta q\psi }-2)-{\frac {\epsilon _{0}\epsilon }{2}}\left({\frac {d\psi }{dz}}\right)^{2}} From a known electrical potential profile ψ(z) one can calculate the disjoining pressure from this equation at any suitable position z. Alternative derivation of the same relation for disjoining pressure involves the stress tensor. == Debye-Hückel model == When the electric potentials or charge densities are not too high, the PB equation can be simplified to the Debye-Hückel (DH) equation. By expanding the exponential function in the PB equation into a Taylor series, one obtains d 2 ψ d z 2 = κ 2 ψ {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\psi }{dz^{2}}}=\kappa ^{2}\psi } where κ 2 = 2 β q 2 c B ε 0 ε {\displaystyle \;\;\;\kappa ^{2}={\frac {2\beta q^{2}c_{\rm {B}}}{\epsilon _{0}\epsilon }}} The parameter κ−1 is referred to as the Debye length, and some representative values for a monovalent salt in water at 25°C with ε ≃ 80 are given in the table on the right.
