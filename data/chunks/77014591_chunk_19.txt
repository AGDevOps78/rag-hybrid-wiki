Langeslag has recommended distraction as an antidote to the short-term decrease in mood. Negative reappraisal can be useful, for example, to those who want to ameliorate heartbreak or put an end to an abusive relationship. In positive reappraisal, one focuses on positive qualities of the beloved ("he's kind", "she's spontaneous"), the relationship ("we have so much fun together") or imagined future scenarios ("we'll live happily ever after"). Positive reappraisal increases attachment and can increase relationship satisfaction, which could, for example, help stabilize a long-term relationship. Love regulation does not switch feelings on or off immediately, so Langeslag recommends, for example, writing a list of things once a day to feel a lasting change. == Biology == Passionate and companionate love are thought to be interrelated but involve different brain systems and serve different purposes. Passionate love is thought to have evolved for mate choice or to initiate a pair bond, while companionate love is for maintaining a pair bond, maintaining close proximity and affiliative behaviors. Passionate love is often associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine.
