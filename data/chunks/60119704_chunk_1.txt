The display may either wrap around to the back of the device when folded, as seen with the Royole FlexPai and Huawei Mate X, or use a booklet-style design, where the larger, folded screen is located inside and a smaller screen on the cover allows interaction without opening the device, as with the Samsung Galaxy Fold series. Horizontally folding smartphones have also been produced, typically using a clamshell form factor. The first generation of commercially released foldable smartphones faced concerns over durability and their high prices, and they are largely regarded as a gimmick. In 2023, only around 1% of worldwide smartphone ownership were foldable smartphones. == History == In 2006, Polymer Vision showed a roll-able concept and a foldable smartphone, the Readius (zh), at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) which also serves as a reader. In 2008, Nokia presented animated concepts of a flexible device it dubbed "Morph", which had a tri-fold design that could be bended into various forms, such as a large unfolded device, a feature phone-sized unit, and a smart wristband. In a 2019 retrospective on the concept, CNET noted that Morph could be considered a forerunner to the first wave of commercially produced folding phones, as well as a showcase of future possibilities. In 2011, Kyocera released a dual-touchscreen Android smartphone known as the Echo, which featured a pair of 3.5-inch touchscreens.
