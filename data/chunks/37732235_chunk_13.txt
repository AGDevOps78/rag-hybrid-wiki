== Extensions to other geometries == Interactions between various objects were studied within the DH and PB models by many researchers. Some of the relevant results are summarized in the following. Non-planar geometries: Objects of other than planar geometries can be treated within the Derjaguin approximation, provided their size is substantially larger than the Debye length. This approximation has been used to estimate the force between two charged colloidal particles as shown in the first figure of this article. The exponential nature of these repulsive forces and the fact that its range is given by the Debye length was confirmed experimentally by direct force measurements, including surface forces apparatus, colloidal probe technique, or optical tweezers. The interaction free energy involving two spherical particles within the DH approximation follows the Yukawa or screened Coulomb potential U = Q 2 4 π ε ε 0 ( e κ a 1 + κ a ) 2 e − κ r r {\displaystyle U={\frac {Q^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon \epsilon _{0}}}\left({\frac {e^{\kappa a}}{1+\kappa a}}\right)^{2}{\frac {e^{-\kappa r}}{r}}} where r is the center-to-center distance, Q is the particle charge, and a the particle radius. This expression is based on the superposition approximation and is only valid at large separations. This equation can be extended to more highly charged particles by reinterpreting the charge Q as an effective charge.
