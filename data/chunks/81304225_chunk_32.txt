Provenance (channels of transmission) is kept analytically distinct from evidential claims, with outcomes often interpreted through common factors and meaning responses in structured settings. === Symbol work === Symbol-oriented work includes the redeployment of oracular media—e.g., tarot, astrology and the I Ching—as projective prompts in counselling and self-exploration. In Jungian and humanistic milieus, practice centres on image, narrative construction and reflective dialogue rather than on divinatory epistemologies; references to synchronicity provided an interpretive rationale for treating draws, charts and hexagrams as meaningful coincidences to be worked hermeneutically, not as predictive proofs. In educational and pastoral contexts, symbolic devices have similarly been used for guidance and values-clarification, further decoupling symbolic efficacy from realist–occult claims. === Trance, breathing and psychedelics === Although often framed in physiological or psychological terms, relaxation, guided imagery, and breath-culture systems developed within harmonial and New Thought milieus (see also Body and attention for later somatic adaptations) functioned as practical psychologizations (popular psychology) of esoteric ideas—linking inner discipline, divine influx, and mental causation. Scholars of Western esotericism interpret these as early instances of “psychologized esotericism” preceding formal schools of psychotherapy. Beyond explicitly mystical or trance-based techniques, late nineteenth-century harmonial and New Thought movements developed gentler forms of psychophysical practice—relaxation, guided imagery, and breath-culture systems—that aimed at balancing mind and body without inducing altered states. Decades later, in transpersonal milieus, there were developed altered state of consciousness techniques that range from clinical hypnosis and guided breathing to psychedelic-assisted sessions.
