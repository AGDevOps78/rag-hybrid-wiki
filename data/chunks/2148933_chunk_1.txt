Social psychiatry can be contrasted with biopsychiatry, which focuses on genetics, brain neurochemistry and medication. Social psychiatry has influenced U.S. social policy and social movements, including the community mental health movement and the era of deinstitutionalization. == History == === Early 20th century === The term "social psychiatry" can be traced back to 1903 in a paper by German psychiatrist Georg Ilberg, 'Soziale Psychiatrie.' In it, Ilberg defined social psychiatry as factors that affect the mental health of populations and ways in which to prevent mental illness among society. Ilberg argued that there were many factors that influenced mental health, but the majority of mental illnesses were hereditary. In 1911, German psychiatrist Max Fischer defined social psychiatry as "the act of providing psychiatric care outside of asylums", and advocated for the creation of welfare centers to deliver psychiatric care outside of asylums. At this time in Germany, social psychiatry emphasized protection of the general public of those who are mentally ill and 'antisocial.' ==== United States mental health community movement ==== The mental hygiene movement in the United States marked a shift from individual responsibility of mental health to how public health and society could promote mental health. In 1909, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now called Mental Health America) was created to focus on mental illness prevention and mental health promotion.
