Companionate love might also precede passionate love sometimes. There is some reason to think attachment takes about two years to develop, for example one study found that participants who had been in a relationship for about this long named their romantic partner as an attachment figure, while other participants named a parent. One estimate for the duration of passionate love is 18 months to 3 years, which comes from survey data collected by Dorothy Tennov, for her 1979 book Love and Limerence. Another estimate comes from a 1999 experiment performed by Donatelli Marazziti and colleagues which found a difference in blood serotonin levels between newly in love people and controls, and found these levels had returned to normal after 12 to 18 months. Intense attraction can also last much longer in rarer cases, as in the phenomenon of long-term intense romantic love. These lovers tend to show lower levels of obsession than in the early stage, however. Companionate love is thought to build over time as a relationship progresses, but then decrease very slowly over the course of several decades. In the past, some have thought companionate love to be stable after it develops, but for example one study of new marriages found a decline after a 1-year period.
