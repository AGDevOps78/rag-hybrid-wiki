In this case, the electrical potential profile ψ(z) near a charged interface will only depend on the position z. The corresponding Poisson's equation reads in SI units d 2 ψ d z 2 = − ρ ε 0 ε {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\psi }{dz^{2}}}=-{\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0}\epsilon }}} where ρ is the charge density per unit volume, ε0 the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum, and ε the dielectric constant of the liquid. For a symmetric electrolyte consisting of cations and anions having a charge ±q, the charge density can be expressed as ρ = q ( c + − c − ) {\displaystyle \rho =q(c_{+}-c_{-})} where c± = N±/V are the concentrations of the cations and anions, where N± are their numbers and V the sample volume. These profiles can be related to the electrical potential by considering the fact that the chemical potential of the ions is constant. For both ions, this relation can be written as μ ± = μ + ( 0 ) + k T ln ⁡ c ± ± q ψ {\displaystyle \mu _{\pm }=\mu _{+}^{(0)}+kT\ln c_{\pm }\pm q\psi } where μ ± ( 0 ) {\displaystyle \mu _{\pm }^{(0)}} is the reference chemical potential, T the absolute temperature, and k the Boltzmann constant. The reference chemical potential can be eliminated by applying the same equation far away from the surface where the potential is assumed to vanish and concentrations attain the bulk concentration cB. The concentration profiles thus become c ± = c B e ∓ β q ψ {\displaystyle c_{\pm }=c_{\rm {B}}e^{\mp \beta q\psi }} where β = 1/(kT). This relation reflects the Boltzmann distribution of the ions with the energy ±qψ.
