Scholars of American religion such as Catherine L. Albanese interpret this Transcendentalist synthesis as part of the broader harmonial or metaphysical current that linked moral and mental harmony with spiritual vitality. This intellectual milieu provided a cultural background for later mind-cure and New Thought movements, in which esoteric motifs of correspondence and transformation were increasingly psychologized and reframed as methods of self-regulation and healing. Within the social worlds of spiritualism and early psychical research, clinicians and philosophers used trance cases to theorise divided consciousness. Pierre Janet’s work on dissociation systematised observations of automatisms (automatic writing, trance speech) as expressions of partitioned awareness, while discussions by William James and Sigmund Freud—both attentive to hypnosis and to hysteria debates—helped normalise psychological framings that did not rely on occult fluids or literal spirit agencies. Case-rich monographs such as Théodore Flournoy’s study of glossolalia and secondary personalities supplied detailed documentation without doctrinal commitments, furnishing materials for theorising imagination, suggestion and divided consciousness in secular terms. By the century’s end, comparative and indological presentations had begun to recast selected Asian repertoires in psychological or mentalist terms for Western audiences—for example, Neo-Vedantic readings of Raja Yoga within modern interpretations of Yoga—foreshadowing twentieth-century migrations of somatic–attentional techniques into wellness and para-clinical niches. Tradition interfaces in this period Mesmerism and induced “somnambulism” popularised controlled trance and supplied early conduits from esoteric milieus to psychological technique (later recoded as hypnosis and suggestion).
