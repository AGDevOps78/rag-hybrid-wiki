Transpersonal psychology theorised non-ordinary states and integrated selected esoteric vocabularies (subtle-body maps, archetypal language, ritual techniques) into developmental models. In parallel, Fourth Way circles associated with G. I. Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky supplied movement and dramaturgic formats later adapted in self-development workshops. Transpersonal circles also developed experiential cartographies through psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and, later, breathwork protocols (e.g., holotropic breathwork), integrating archetypal and symbolic vocabularies while bracketing realist–occult claims. Institutional and editorial hubs in this period The Eranos meetings (Ascona) interfaced Jungian circles with history-of-religions scholarship, stabilising psychological readings of premodern symbol-systems (including Asian corpora) in interpretive, non-realist frames.
