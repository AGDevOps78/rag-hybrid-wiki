While not esoteric in doctrine, such programmes circulated in the same workshop economies as symbolic counselling and energy-themed practices, and at times repackaged esoteric maps (archetypes, “energy”, transformation) in optimisation language. Systematic reviews report insufficient evidence for robust effects and note pervasive methodological limitations. Educational and pastoral counselling contexts also served as diffusion channels: personality typologies (MBTI; the modern Enneagram) and symbolic counselling devices were adopted for guidance and self-exploration, often framed under values education or spiritual accompaniment. Within this translation, symbolic/interpretive uses were normalised over realist–occult claims. At the edges of popular psychology, ritualised or dramaturgic formats were marketed for personal change. The term “psychomagic” has been used for symbolic–ritual interventions in advice literature and workshops, with genealogical ties to esoteric repertoires and mythopoetic narratives; scholarly treatments read these as cultural phenomena within contemporary occulture rather than as established clinical modalities. Likewise, family constellations circulate in coaching and group-work settings with strong dramaturgic elements; reviews highlight mixed evidence and methodological concerns, advising caution and clear framing when used in para-clinical contexts. Some masculinity coaching and men’s-group ecologies drew selectively on Jungian archetypal vocabularies and, in some milieus, on neo-tantric, neidan, or polarity of “energy” (Sulphur or Sun-masculine/Mercury or Moon-femenine from alchemy, Shiva/Shakti, yin and yang) rhetorics, illustrating how symbolic repertoires are operationalised in advice genres outside formal clinical frameworks.
