Western esotericism and psychology surveys the documented exchanges between Western esotericism—including Westernized hybrids of Asian traditions—and selected areas of psychology, psychotherapy, and popular psychology. From the late eighteenth century onward, conduits such as animal magnetism and early hypnosis (reinterpreted from mesmeric “somnambulism”), Spiritualism/psychical research, and fin de siècle occultism and comparative projects created channels by which esoteric repertoires (e.g., alchemy, astrology, and subtle body schemes) were translated into psychological idioms or embedded in therapeutic and self-development techniques. In the twentieth century, these exchanges were variously articulated in analytical psychology (including Jung’s alchemical hermeneutics), humanistic workshop cultures and the human potential movement, transpersonal psychology, and symbolic counselling that repurposed oracular media (e.g., tarot, astrology, or the I Ching). Rather than a single genealogy, historians emphasise plural processes of transmission, translation, and hybridisation across specific networks and publics—among them Theosophy (with codified chakras and subtle bodies), Anthroposophy (linking esoteric doctrines to pedagogical and para-clinical projects), the Eranos circle (mediating Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions), and late-modern markets often labelled “New Age”. Sociological accounts frame the broader diffusion via the late-modern “cultic milieu” and “occulture”, which describe how esoteric symbols and narratives circulate beyond formal religion through publishing, workshops, retreats and wellness/coaching niches, where psychologised self-work became a prominent vector of reception. == Scope and definitions == === Definitions === In the academic literature, Western esotericism is approached not as a single doctrine but as a modern Western form of thought. A widely used componential definition was formulated by the historian of religion Antoine Faivre, who identified four intrinsic features—(1) correspondences linking microcosm and macrocosm, (2) a living nature open to hidden forces, (3) the primacy of imagination and mediations (e.g., images, symbols, rites), and (4) transmutation (psychic or spiritual transformation)—together with two relative traits, (5) concordance among traditions and (6) transmission (initiatory or doctrinal). Hanegraaff’s overviews present this scheme as a heuristic for describing modern formations rather than as an ontology.
