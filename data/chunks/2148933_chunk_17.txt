Vulnerabilities can include genetic predispositions, neurobiological abnormalities, or personality traits, while stressors refer to environmental and social factors such as trauma, poverty, discrimination, or interpersonal conflict. The model outlines how mental health problems progress to full-blown disorders when stressors exceed an individual's coping resources and resilience. In social psychiatry, the Stress-Vulnerability Model provides a framework for understanding how social and environmental factors contribute to mental illness. This perspective shifts the focus from purely biological causes to the broader social context, recognizing that reducing external stressors and enhancing social support can mitigate mental health risks. === Community-based care and prevention === Social psychiatry advocates for community-based care and preventive measures to address mental health issues, rather than solely relying on traditional hospital-based care. Public policy analyst Gerald Caplan laid the foundation for preventative mental health care in his 1964 book, Principles of Preventative Psychiatry, where he argues that early intervention in community settings can reduce mental illness stigma and promote mental health. By shifting the focus from individual pathology to the social context, community-based care promotes recovery, reduces stigma, and improves overall well-being. Community-based care offers a range of services, including early intervention, crisis intervention, medication management, therapy, and rehabilitation.
