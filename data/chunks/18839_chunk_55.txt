Questions include: What is the definition of music? (What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for classifying something as music?) What is the relationship between music and mind? What does music history reveal to us about the world? What is the connection between music and emotions? What is meaning in relation to music? In ancient times, such as with the Ancient Greeks, the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (plaisir and jouissance) of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Immanuel Kant.
