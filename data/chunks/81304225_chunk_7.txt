Placed within the wider narrative of Western esotericism and psychology, what Albanese terms harmonial religion (and Foxen discusses as harmonialism)—ranging from Swedenborgian metaphysics through mesmerism, mind-cure and breath culture—constitutes a proto-psychological strand of modern esoteric thought. These formations prefigure the twentieth-century “psychologization of religion” analysed by Wouter J. Hanegraaff, wherein spiritual transformation and mental hygiene converge as parallel idioms of self-regulation and correspondence. == Periodisation of the intersection == === Enlightenment to nineteenth century === From late Enlightenment experiments in animal magnetism and guided “somnambulism” to fin-de-siècle debates on suggestion and trance, early interfaces between esoteric repertoires and psychological inquiry unfolded across salons, clinics and séance rooms. Mesmeric practices circulated the idea of an invisible influence acting upon body and mind; controlled inductions and narrative management of altered states provided techniques and cases that would be reframed in medical and psychological vocabularies. During the early nineteenth century, the Transcendentalist movement in the United States—particularly the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson—absorbed elements of Western esotericism, including Swedenborgian doctrines of correspondences—which interpreted the visible world as an image of inner and spiritual processes—and Neoplatonic conceptions of the "Over-Soul". Scholars of American religion such as Catherine L. Albanese interpret this Transcendentalist synthesis as part of the broader harmonial or metaphysical current that linked moral and mental harmony with spiritual vitality.
