There are numerous different dye indicators that can be used as optical, luminescence-based oxygen sensing, which is based on the phenomenon of luminescence quenching by oxygen, without consuming oxygen in the system. This technique makes monitoring oxygen in microscale environments feasible and can be applied in biological laboratories. === Temperature control === Temperature can be sensed by cells and influences their behavior, such as biochemical reaction kinetics. However, it is hard to control high-resolution temperature in traditional cell culture systems; whereas, microfluidic systems are proven to successfully reach the desired temperature under different temperature conditions through several techniques. For example, the temperature gradient in the microfluidic system can be achieved by mixing two or more inputs at different temperatures and flow rates, and the temperature is measured in the outlet channels by embedding polymer-based aquarium thermocouples. Also, by installing heaters and digital temperature sensors at the base of the microfluidic system, it has been demonstrated that a microfluidic cell culture system can continuously operate for at least 500 hours. The circulating water channels in the microfluidic system are also used to precisely control temperatures of the cell culture channels and chambers. Furthermore, putting the device inside a cell culture incubator can also easily control the cell culture temperature.
