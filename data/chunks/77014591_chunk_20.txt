Passionate love is thought to have evolved for mate choice or to initiate a pair bond, while companionate love is for maintaining a pair bond, maintaining close proximity and affiliative behaviors. Passionate love is often associated with the neurotransmitter dopamine. Companionate love is often associated with the neuropeptide oxytocin, and sometimes vasopressin or endogenous opioids. Passionate love is sometimes compared to addiction, although there are differences. People in the early stages of romantic love share similar traits with addicts (for example, feeling rushes of euphoria, or craving for their beloved), but this tends to wear off over time, while the condition of a drug addiction tends to worsen. Helen Fisher has suggested romantic love is a "positive addiction" (i.e. not harmful) when reciprocated and a "negative addiction" when unrequited or inappropriate. == See also == == References == === Bibliography === == External links == The Passionate Love Scale at Helen Fisher and Lucy Brown's website.
