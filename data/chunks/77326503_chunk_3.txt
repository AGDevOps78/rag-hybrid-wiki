The experimental fact that charging occurs is very well documented, although details of the exact process remain a topic of debate. High speed video observations show how water spray can breakup into different droplets. Larger droplets tend to be positively charged, while smaller ones negative; this charge separation is also well documented for solids. For instance it occurs in commercial powder processing and in natural processes such as dust storms, There can be electric fields of up to 160kV/m with moderate wind conditions, which leads to Coulomb forces of about the same magnitude as gravity. There can also be contributions from contact potential differences between liquids or gases and other materials, similar to the work function differences for solids. It has been suggested that a triboelectric series for liquids is useful. One difference from solids is that often liquids have charged double layers, and most of the work to date supports that ion transfer (rather than electron) dominates for liquids as first suggested by Irving Langmuir in 1938. All these processes will lead to charges, relatively high electric fields and these in turn can lead to the formation of gaseous ions.
