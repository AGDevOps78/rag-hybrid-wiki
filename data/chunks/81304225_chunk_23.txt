Within the field’s literature, commentators emphasise both genealogical debts to Western esotericism (e.g., Jungian hermeneutics, occultist codifications of subtle bodies) and the need for source-critical distinctions between symbolic/interpretive framings and realist–occult claims. Reviews at the psychology–religion interface also recommend keeping genealogical description analytically separate from empirical appraisal of outcomes in clinical or para-clinical contexts. In boundary zones adjacent to transpersonal studies, parapsychology continued the nineteenth-century psychical-research agenda in laboratory and survey settings (e.g., studies of telepathy or clairvoyance); in this article such intersections are treated as historical interfaces with psychology rather than as evidential endorsements. In this milieu, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy and adjacent “psychonautics”—most prominently in the early work of Stanislav Grof (e.g., LSD psychotherapy and later holotropic breathwork)—were framed as laboratories for mapping non-ordinary states with archetypal and symbolic vocabularies. Such programmes illustrate the field’s dual emphasis on experiential method and interpretive framing, while reviews at the psychology–religion interface caution to separate genealogical links to esoteric repertoires from evidential claims and to distinguish clinical protocols from neoshamanic or ritual translations. === Anthroposophic clinical and pedagogical therapies === In Anthroposophy, esoteric doctrines were extended into pedagogy and para-clinical practice, associating imagination and development with disciplined movement, colour and form. Under banners such as Eurythmy and arts-based therapeutic work, anthroposophic centres and clinics—organised around hubs like the Goetheanum—framed symbolic movement and creative exercises as instruments for well-being, rehabilitation or education, sometimes alongside subtle-body explanations and sometimes within secular pedagogical vocabularies. These programmes illustrate a pathway by which modern occultist repertoires entered educational and therapeutic niches: ritualised movement, diagrammatic grammars and guided imagination were re-coded as techniques for development and regulation in schoolrooms, clinics and workshops.
