Another open multi-culture device fabricated by razor-printing is capable of integrating numerous culture modalities, including 2D, 3D, Transwell, and spheroid culture. It also shows improved diffusion to promote soluble factor paracrine signaling. == Controlling cell microenvironment == Microfluidic systems expand their ability to control the local cell microenvironment beyond what is possible with conventional culture systems. Being able to provide different environments in a steady, sustainable and precise manner has a significant impact on cell culture research and study. Those environmental factors include physical (shear stress), biochemical (cell-cell interactions, cell-molecule interactions, cell-substrate interactions), and physicochemical (pH, CO2, temperature, O2) factors. === Oxygen concentration control === Oxygen plays an essential role in biological systems. Oxygen concentration control is one of the key elements when designing the microfluidic systems, whether the aerobic species or when modulating cellular functions in vivo, such as baseline metabolism and function. Multiple microfluidic systems have been designed to control the desired gas concentrations for cell culture.
