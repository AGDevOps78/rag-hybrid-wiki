Although social psychiatry was not involved in these therapies, its mainstream status as a field resulted in eroded trust among psychotherapists and psychiatrists. Biological psychiatry as a field was rising in popularity during these counter-culture movements, further eroding social psychiatry as a field. Technological advancements in brain imaging techniques influenced this shift in focus and provided genetic and biological explanations for psychiatric disorders, rather than social explanations. These advancements in neurology, psychopharmacology, and genetics fueled the rise of pharmacological drugs like Prozac, for mental disorders and deemphasized the need for psychotherapy. By the 1980s, biological psychiatry had overtaken social psychiatry as the premier mode of research in mental illness. == Core theories and concepts == Social psychiatry emphasizes how social, cultural, and environmental factors influence mental health and illness. It focuses on understanding and addressing the social determinants of mental health, the role of relationships and community in psychological well-being, and the prevention and treatment of mental disorders within broader social contexts. === Psychobiology === Psychobiology, a term first coined by Adolf Meyer in the early 20th century, refers to an interdisciplinary approach to understanding behavior and mental health by integrating biological, psychological, and social factors.
