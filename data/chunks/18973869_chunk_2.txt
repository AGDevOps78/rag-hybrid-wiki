Due to the absence of objective biological pathology (such as tissue damage or biomarkers), prominent critics such as Thomas Szasz and Peter Breggin have characterized the field as a pseudoscience or a form of social control masquerading as medicine. Additionally, the 'chemical imbalance' theory used to market psychiatric drugs for decades was recently identified as empirically unsubstantiated by a major 2022 review, leading to accusations of systemic pharmaceutical marketing fraud. Furthermore, the paradigm of chronic pharmaceutical maintenance has been challenged by longitudinal studies, such as the 20-year Chicago Follow-up Study (Harrow et al.), which found that patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who discontinued antipsychotic medication achieved significantly higher rates of functional recovery and employment compared to those who remained medicated. == Etymology == The term psychiatry was first coined by the German physician Johann Christian Reil in 1808 and literally means the 'medical treatment of the soul' (ψυχή psych- 'soul' from Ancient Greek psykhē 'soul'; -iatry 'medical treatment' from Gk. ιατρικός iātrikos 'medical' from ιάσθαι iāsthai 'to heal'). A medical doctor specializing in psychiatry is a psychiatrist (for a historical overview, see: Timeline of psychiatry). == Theory and focus == Psychiatry refers to a field of medicine focused specifically on the mind, aiming to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders in humans. It has been described as an intermediary between the world from a social context and the world from the perspective of those who are mentally ill.
