In workshop and clinical formats, psychosynthesis employed structured sequences (evocation of imagery, reflective processing, value clarification) that align with humanistic and transpersonal milieus in which ritualised settings and symbolic repertoires were redeployed for experiential learning. Reviews at the psychology–religion interface underline the need to separate genealogical description from empirical appraisal and to keep realist–occult claims distinct from interpretive, “as-if real” framings. === Somatic and bioenergetic psychology === Wilhelm Reich’s somatic psychotherapy, developed as vegetotherapy and later orgonomy, sought to integrate emotional release with muscular and respiratory dynamics. Although Reich presented his model as biophysics rather than spirituality, his concept of orgone—a universal life energy said to permeate both psyche and cosmos—echoed older vitalist and mesmerist cosmologies. Scholars such as Christopher Partridge and Egil Asprem interpret Reich’s system as part of the modern afterlife of esoteric vitalism, where notions of subtle energy were reformulated within psychological and quasi-scientific vocabularies. In historiographical perspective, Wouter J. Hanegraaff classifies this type of “biophysical occultism” under the rubric of “rejected knowledge”: claims framed as science but conceptually aligned with esoteric models of energy and self-transformation. In the postwar period, “neo-Reichian” movements extended these ideas into expressive and group-based psychotherapies that combined breathing, grounding, and cathartic movement.
