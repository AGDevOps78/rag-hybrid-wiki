Beyond explicitly mystical or trance-based techniques, late nineteenth-century harmonial and New Thought movements developed gentler forms of psychophysical practice—relaxation, guided imagery, and breath-culture systems—that aimed at balancing mind and body without inducing altered states. Decades later, in transpersonal milieus, there were developed altered state of consciousness techniques that range from clinical hypnosis and guided breathing to psychedelic-assisted sessions. Across otherwise divergent framings, practice typically combines induction (or pharmacological set/setting), focused attention and post-experience integration, with symbolic material (imagery, archetypal language, ritual scripts) recruited as aids to meaning-making and restructuring. Scholarship in transpersonal studies stresses separating genealogy from efficacy and distinguishing clinical protocols (screening, preparation, integration) from neoshamanic or workshop translations. A related practice are late–twentieth-century “active/dynamic meditations” that blend breathwork, rhythmic movement and brief catharsis with Eastern symbolic vocabularies (e.g. "kundalini activation" with neotantric or yogic language); in practice they circulated through humanistic and transpersonal workshop markets as psychologized self-regulation techniques. === Arts-based psychotherapies and counselling === ==== Ritual movement and dramatization ==== Ritualised and dramatic formats—ranging from structured openings and closures to role-work, gesture, and symbolic sequencing—translate esoteric dramaturgies into educational, humanistic, and para-clinical settings oriented toward self-insight and emotional regulation. In workshop and counselling circuits influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychology, the emphasis falls on containment, process, and symbolic rehearsal rather than on doctrinal belief, illustrating how ritual and theatrical devices were reframed as psychological techniques.
