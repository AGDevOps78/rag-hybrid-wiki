In the medical community, poverty is considered an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE). ==== Class and socioeconomic status ==== Social psychiatry examines class and socioeconomic status (SES) as factors that shape mental health by influencing access to power, privilege, and resources. Research shows that employment instability, low-paying jobs, and poor working conditions are linked to higher rates of psychological distress. In his book The Impact of Inequality: How to Make Sick Societies Healthier, British epidemiologist Richard G. Wilkinson outlines how lower-class individuals can experience "status anxiety" or humiliation tied to social stratification, which impacts mental health. Class disparities can also shape perceptions and treatment of mental illness, with working-class populations often encountering greater stigma and fewer resources. Social psychiatry also emphasizes the importance of intersectionality; the interplay of class, race, and gender can amplify risks for mental illness. ==== Education ==== Social psychiatry views education as both a pathway to improved mental health and a source of stress or inequity.
