This simplifies many aspects of classical geometry by unifying the treatments for intersecting and parallel lines. Affine geometry, the study of properties relative to parallelism and independent from the concept of length. Differential geometry, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using differentiable functions. Manifold theory, the study of shapes that are not necessarily embedded in a larger space. Riemannian geometry, the study of distance properties in curved spaces. Algebraic geometry, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using polynomials. Topology, the study of properties that are kept under continuous deformations. Algebraic topology, the use in topology of algebraic methods, mainly homological algebra.
