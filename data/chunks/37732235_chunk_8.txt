However, in this case one has to replace the actual diffuse layer potential ψD with the effective potential ψeff. Within the PB model, this effective potential can be evaluated analytically, and reads ψ e f f = 4 β q tanh ⁡ ( β q ψ D ) {\displaystyle \psi _{\rm {eff}}={\frac {4}{\beta q}}\tanh(\beta q\psi _{\rm {D}})} The superposition approximation can be easily extended to asymmetric systems. Analogous arguments lead to the expression for the disjoining pressure Π ( h ) = 2 ε ε 0 κ 2 ψ e f f ( 1 ) ψ e f f ( 2 ) e − κ h {\displaystyle \Pi (h)=2\epsilon \epsilon _{0}\kappa ^{2}\psi _{\rm {eff}}^{(1)}\psi _{\rm {eff}}^{(2)}e^{-\kappa h}} where the super-scripted quantities refer to properties of the respective surface. At larger distances, oppositely charged surfaces repel and equally charged ones attract. == Charge regulating surfaces == While the superposition approximation is actually exact at larger distances, it is no longer accurate at smaller separations. Solutions of the DH or PB equations in between the plates provide a more accurate picture at these conditions. Let us only discuss the symmetric situation within the DH model here. This discussion will introduce the notion of charge regulation, which suggests that the surface charge (and the surface potential) may vary (or regulate) upon approach.
