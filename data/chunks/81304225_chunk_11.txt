Theosophy articulated a modern discourse on subtle bodies and diffused codified “chakra” schemes through handbooks and visual plates that circulated well beyond initiatory settings; these maps furnished a flexible idiom for inner states and “energy” later reframed in counselling and self-development. At the same time, Anthroposophy extended esoteric doctrines into education and para-clinical practice, associating imagination and development with disciplined movement and arts-based therapies (e.g., Eurythmy). Organisationally, anthroposophic centres linked doctrine, pedagogy and therapeutic experiments, creating channels by which symbolic repertoires reached classrooms, clinics and workshops. In North Atlantic contexts, an American strand labelled New Thought (or “mental healing”) supplied vocabularies of mental causation and affirmation that later fed self-help and coaching cultures. Historians read these idioms as part of a broader late-modern psychologization of religious repertoires that facilitated their translation into popular psychological frames. One of the main intellectual bridges of mind-cure/New Thought with earlier esotericisms and scholar philosophy of mind was the swedenborgian minister Warren Felt Evans, who articulated a doctrine of “mental therapeutics” by combining mesmeric suggestion with Emanuel Swedenborg’s mysticism, the American mind-cure tradition, and the subjective idealism of George Berkeley. Alongside occultist codifications, late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century comparative religion and history of religions projects created interpretive frames for reading premodern symbol-systems (e.g., alchemical, visionary or divinatory corpora) in dialogue with emerging psychological languages. Philological and comparative syntheses furnished taxonomies and narratives that could later be reframed in counselling and self-work, a trajectory consolidated in the 1930s around forums integrating Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions approaches, including figures later associated with the Eranos circle such as Mircea Eliade and Henry Corbin.
