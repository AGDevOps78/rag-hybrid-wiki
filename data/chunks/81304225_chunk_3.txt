These tags are heuristic and remain distinct from genealogical claims or value judgements. == Historiography and frameworks == Modern scholarship generally treats Faivre’s componential definition as a heuristic grid rather than as an ontology for what esotericism “is”. In this perspective, the grid helps historians describe how symbolic mediations and techniques of transformation were translated into psychological idioms in specific periods and publics, while avoiding essentialist claims. Placed within nineteenth- and twentieth-century contexts, Wouter J. Hanegraaff proposes an etic use of “occultism” for modern currents that explored interfaces between science, comparative religion and esoteric practice, and describes a two-way traffic between religious and psychological languages—“psychologization of religion” and “sacralization of psychology”—to account for the reception of alchemy, astrology and subtle-body maps in theory, therapy and self-work. For diffusion beyond academic or ecclesiastical institutions, historians of contemporary religion draw on sociological models. The notion of the cultic milieu proposed by Colin Campbell designates an environment in which heterodox repertoires (e.g., astrology, trance, subtle bodies) persist, recirculate and recombine; Christopher Partridge’s “occulture” points to a cultural reservoir mediated by publishing, media and popular culture, through which psychologised self-work, workshops and wellness/coaching markets became prominent vectors of reception. Within this historiographic framing, hubs such as the Eranos meetings in Switzerland functioned as interfaces between Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions approaches, helping to normalise psychological readings of premodern symbol-systems (including Asian repertoires) in interpretive, non-realist terms.
