Blocking their formation, disrupting their cohesion, or preventing their ability to survive in the bloodstream could offer new ways to prevent metastasis in aggressive cancers. Continued studies will be essential to further elucidate the biological pathways involved in CTC cluster-mediated metastasis and develop potential treatment interventions. == References ==
