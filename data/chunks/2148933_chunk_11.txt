=== Social determinants of mental health === Social psychiatry emphasizes how different societal and environmental factors influence mental health and contribute to psychiatric disorders. Below are some of the core factors the field has identified. ==== Housing and urbanization ==== Housing is recognized as a fundamental determinant of mental health, serving as both a basic human need and a stabilizing factor in people's lives. Social psychiatry attributes those with housing instability, such as frequent moves, evictions, or homelessness, generates stress, disrupts social support networks, with higher risk of psychiatric disorders. Poor living conditions, including overcrowding, unsafe environments, and exposure to hazards like mold or lead, further exacerbate mental health challenges, particularly in children. Residential segregation, often resulting from systemic issues like redlining and gentrification, concentrates marginalized communities in under-resourced areas, perpetuating mental health disparities. Conversely, stable and affordable housing provides psychological safety, fostering a sense of control and security that protects mental well-being. ==== Poverty ==== Social psychiatry views poverty as a critical determinant of mental health, emphasizing its role in creating chronic stress, limited access to resources, and systemic barriers to care.
