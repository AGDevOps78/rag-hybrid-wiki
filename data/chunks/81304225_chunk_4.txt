The notion of the cultic milieu proposed by Colin Campbell designates an environment in which heterodox repertoires (e.g., astrology, trance, subtle bodies) persist, recirculate and recombine; Christopher Partridge’s “occulture” points to a cultural reservoir mediated by publishing, media and popular culture, through which psychologised self-work, workshops and wellness/coaching markets became prominent vectors of reception. Within this historiographic framing, hubs such as the Eranos meetings in Switzerland functioned as interfaces between Jungian hermeneutics and history-of-religions approaches, helping to normalise psychological readings of premodern symbol-systems (including Asian repertoires) in interpretive, non-realist terms. The article therefore combines componential description with diffusion models to track how esoteric repertoires travelled into psychological theory, clinical/para-clinical settings, and popular counselling cultures. Jung’s theorisation of synchronicity is often cited as part of the modern “psychologization of religion”, supplying a vocabulary by which divinatory repertoires could be recoded for counselling without realist–occult commitments. === Rejected knowledge by academic psychology === In this line of analysis, Wouter J. Hanegraaff introduced the notion of rejected knowledge to describe bodies of thought and practice that once claimed rational or scientific legitimacy but were later excluded from academic discourse. The concept provides historians with a tool for understanding why movements such as mesmerism, psychical research, or vitalist biophysics—though not self-identified as “esoteric”—nonetheless display structural affinities with the esoteric field through their use of subtle-force cosmologies, analogical reasoning, and transformative techniques. === Psychologization of esotericism (historiographical models) === Scholarship has used “psychologization” to describe how esoteric repertoires were reframed in psychological idioms or channelled through therapeutic formats.
