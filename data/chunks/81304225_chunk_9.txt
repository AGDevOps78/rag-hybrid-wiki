By the century’s end, comparative and indological presentations had begun to recast selected Asian repertoires in psychological or mentalist terms for Western audiences—for example, Neo-Vedantic readings of Raja Yoga within modern interpretations of Yoga—foreshadowing twentieth-century migrations of somatic–attentional techniques into wellness and para-clinical niches. Tradition interfaces in this period Mesmerism and induced “somnambulism” popularised controlled trance and supplied early conduits from esoteric milieus to psychological technique (later recoded as hypnosis and suggestion). spiritualism and early psychical research generated case-materials—automatic writing, trance communication, secondary personalities—that fed debates on imagination and dissociation; Flournoy’s monograph is paradigmatic for this descriptive turn. Late-nineteenth-century indological receptions (e.g., Neo-Vedantic, mentalist readings of Raja Yoga) prefigured the twentieth-century translation of body–attention repertoires into secular or symbolic frames. Institutional and editorial hubs in this period Venues ranged from salons to clinical theatres (e.g., the Salpêtrière in Paris), while the Society for Psychical Research of London (SPR, 1882–) professionalised report genres on automatisms and trance that fed psychological debates on imagination and dissociation. Book-length case studies—such as Flournoy’s—circulated between séance rooms and clinics, helping to normalise descriptive vocabularies for trance phenomena without endorsing occult realism; sociological models later describe such circulations within a broader late-modern “cultic milieu”. === Occultism and comparative religion (late 19th–early 20th centuries) === In the milieu of the Occult Revival of the 19th century in Western societies the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) became a key contact zone between séance cultures and emerging psychological inquiry. Its programmes covered hypnotism, dissociation, mediumship and “thought-transference” (later standardised as telepathy by Frederic W.
