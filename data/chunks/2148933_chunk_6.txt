However, its focus on the 'culture of poverty' rather than poverty itself led to criticism among social scientists and psychiatrists. == The decline of social psychiatry == The shifting terrain of American politics impacted the influence of social psychiatry at a national level. When President Nixon took office in 1969, he dismantled many of the social welfare programs implemented from the war on poverty. In addition, America's involvement in the Vietnam War pulled attention away from domestic affairs and reallocated social welfare spending to war efforts. The 1960s marked several movements that questioned mainstream psychiatry, which social psychiatry had become part of as a result of the policy enacted from its research. Movements like anti-psychiatry, radical psychiatry, and the psychiatric survivors movement protested psychiatric treatments like lobotomies, ECT, and insulin shock therapy. Although social psychiatry was not involved in these therapies, its mainstream status as a field resulted in eroded trust among psychotherapists and psychiatrists. Biological psychiatry as a field was rising in popularity during these counter-culture movements, further eroding social psychiatry as a field.
