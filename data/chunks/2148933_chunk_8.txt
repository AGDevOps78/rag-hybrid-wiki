It focuses on understanding and addressing the social determinants of mental health, the role of relationships and community in psychological well-being, and the prevention and treatment of mental disorders within broader social contexts. === Psychobiology === Psychobiology, a term first coined by Adolf Meyer in the early 20th century, refers to an interdisciplinary approach to understanding behavior and mental health by integrating biological, psychological, and social factors. Meyer, often considered the father of modern American psychiatry, advocated for a holistic perspective that examined the interplay between an individual's biological constitution, psychological experiences, and social environment. This approach was unique because it diverged from models that focused exclusively on either biological or psychodynamic explanations for mental illness. It emphasized the importance of context, life history, and adaptability in understanding human behavior. Psychobiology laid the groundwork for recognizing the role of environmental and relational factors in mental health. By framing psychiatric disorders as dynamic processes influenced by life events and social interactions, psychobiology inspired approaches that consider patients within their broader environment. This influenced later theories, including Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal theory and the study of social determinants of health.
