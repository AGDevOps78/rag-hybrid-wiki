In counselling and workshop circuits, oracular media such as tarot, astrology and the I Ching were repurposed as projective tools within interpretive frames, foregrounding narrative construction and reflective dialogue rather than divinatory truth-claims. Parallel developments recoded esoteric diagrammatics (e.g., Kabbalah’s Tree of Life) as grammars of self-work for lay audiences, often distributed through publishing, courses and retreat formats. Sociological accounts describe these circulations through late-modern occulture and workshop economies that sit largely outside academic psychology but help explain the cultural vigency of hybrid vocabularies of “energy”, archetypes and transformation. Tradition interfaces in this period Within the post-1960s expansion of experiential psychologies, the Gestalt movement (Fritz and Laura Perls; Paul Goodman) became a principal model at Esalen and allied centres. Although not an esoteric tradition, historians note that its here-and-now expressiveness and holistic awareness coexisted with—and helped normalise—a milieu in which esoteric repertoires were reframed in psychological terms, characteristic of the broader human potential and transpersonal currents. Modern yoga supplied body–attention techniques translated into secular or symbolic-psychological idioms in wellness and para-clinical niches. Oracular media (tarot, astrology, I Ching) were redeployed as projective devices in symbolic counselling, while psychological receptions of astrology articulated a counselling idiom distinct from divinatory epistemologies. Contemporary treatments of (Hermetic) Kabbalah adapted diagrammatic grammars (e.g., the Tree of Life) to popular self-development, illustrating how esoteric repertoires circulate through publishing, courses and retreat cultures.
