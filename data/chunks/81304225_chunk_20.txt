Comparative engagements in Jungian circles, including dialogues around classical divination corpora (notably the I Ching), normalised the use of oracular media as projective prompts in counselling and self-exploration. In this milieu, the notion of synchronicity (“an acausal connecting principle”) offered an interpretive rationale for treating draws and charts as meaningful coincidences to be worked hermeneutically rather than as divinatory proofs. Subsequent developments associated with archetypal psychology started by James Hillman emphasised imaginal and mythopoetic registers for clinical reflection, extending the Jungian repertoire of symbols and narratives while maintaining an interpretive (non-realist) stance toward premodern materials. In the broader history of ideas, historians treat these currents as instances of the “psychologization of religion” and “sacralization of psychology” in the twentieth century. === Psychosynthesis === Founded by Roberto Assagioli, psychosynthesis articulated a developmental model integrating will, imagination and symbolic techniques (guided imagery, reflective exercises), framed for psychotherapy and education. While drawing selectively on religious and esoteric vocabularies (e.g., stages, higher/unifying self), psychosynthesis presented these as symbolic devices for integration and meaning-making rather than as doctrinal commitments, and established dedicated training and counselling contexts distinct from Jungian institutions. In workshop and clinical formats, psychosynthesis employed structured sequences (evocation of imagery, reflective processing, value clarification) that align with humanistic and transpersonal milieus in which ritualised settings and symbolic repertoires were redeployed for experiential learning. Reviews at the psychology–religion interface underline the need to separate genealogical description from empirical appraisal and to keep realist–occult claims distinct from interpretive, “as-if real” framings.
