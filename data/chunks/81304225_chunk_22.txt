Hanegraaff classifies this type of “biophysical occultism” under the rubric of “rejected knowledge”: claims framed as science but conceptually aligned with esoteric models of energy and self-transformation. In the postwar period, “neo-Reichian” movements extended these ideas into expressive and group-based psychotherapies that combined breathing, grounding, and cathartic movement. Among them, Alexander Lowen’s bioenergetic analysis, and related body-oriented approaches within the human potential movement integrated performative and affective techniques while recasting them in psychodynamic and secular terms. These modalities demonstrate how vitalist and paraphysical conceptions of body–mind energy migrated from Western esotericism into somatic and transpersonal psychology, bridging the genealogies of dynamic psychiatry and the modern culture of self-regulation. === Transpersonal psychology === Transpersonal psychology systematised mid-twentieth-century developments by theorising non-ordinary states and integrating selected esoteric vocabularies—subtle-body maps, archetypal narratives and ritualised techniques—into psychological models of development, crisis and integration. In practice and training milieus influenced by the Human Potential Movement and venues such as the Esalen Institute, experiential formats (e.g., guided imagery, breathwork, ritualised settings) supplied containers within which symbolic repertoires could be framed for self-exploration and clinical reflection. Within the field’s literature, commentators emphasise both genealogical debts to Western esotericism (e.g., Jungian hermeneutics, occultist codifications of subtle bodies) and the need for source-critical distinctions between symbolic/interpretive framings and realist–occult claims. Reviews at the psychology–religion interface also recommend keeping genealogical description analytically separate from empirical appraisal of outcomes in clinical or para-clinical contexts.
