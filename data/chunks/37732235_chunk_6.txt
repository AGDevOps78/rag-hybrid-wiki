The resulting expression is Π = ε 0 ε 2 [ κ 2 ψ 2 − ( d ψ d z ) 2 ] {\displaystyle \Pi ={\frac {\epsilon _{0}\epsilon }{2}}\left[\kappa ^{2}\psi ^{2}-\left({\frac {d\psi }{dz}}\right)^{2}\right]} The substantial advantage of the DH model over the PB model is that the forces can be obtained analytically. Some of the relevant cases will be discussed below. == Superposition approximation == When the surfaces are sufficiently far apart, the potential profiles originating from each individual surface will not be much perturbed by the presence of the other surface. This approximation thus suggests that one can simply add (superpose) the potentials profiles originating from each surface as illustrated the figure. Since the potential profile passes through a minimum at the mid-plane, it is easiest to evaluate the disjoining pressure at the midplane. The solution of the DH equation for an isolated wall reads ψ ( z ) = ψ D e − κ z {\displaystyle \psi (z)=\psi _{\rm {D}}e^{-\kappa z}} where z is the distance from the surface and ψD the surface potential. The potential at the midplane is thus given by twice the value of this potential at a distance z = h/2. The disjoining pressure becomes Π = 2 ε ε 0 κ 2 ψ D 2 e − κ h {\displaystyle \Pi =2\epsilon \epsilon _{0}\kappa ^{2}\psi _{\rm {D}}^{2}e^{-\kappa h}} The electrostatic double layer force decays in an exponential fashion.
