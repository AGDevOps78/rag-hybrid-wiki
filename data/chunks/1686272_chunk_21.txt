For example, although the American Chemical Society (ACS) requires for foundational courses in a Chemistry Bachelor's degree to include biochemistry, no other biology-related chemistry course is required. Although a chemical biology course is often not required for an undergraduate degree in Chemistry, many universities now provide introductory chemical biology courses for their undergraduate students. The University of British Columbia, for example, offers a fourth-year course in synthetic chemical biology. == See also == Chemoproteomics Chemical genetics Chemogenomics == References == == Further reading == === Journals === ACS Chemical Biology – The new Chemical Biology journal from the American Chemical Society.
