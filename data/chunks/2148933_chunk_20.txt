This phenomenon, social psychiatrists argue, is closely tied to poverty and urbanization. == Research == Social psychiatry integrates different social factors of mental health to advocate for systemic changes, such as improving living conditions, addressing discrimination, and ensuring equitable access to mental health care. By combining quantitative and qualitative methods, social psychiatry research aims to identify effective interventions, reduce stigma, and promote mental health equity. === Epidemiology === Social psychiatry relies on epidemiological data to understand the distribution and determinants of mental health. This involves studying the patterns of mental illness within populations, including prevalence and incidence rates. Researchers often analyze risk factors and protective factors associated with mental disorders. === Life events research === Life events research investigates how significant life events, such as loss, trauma, or major life transitions, can impact mental health. It is one example of a longitudinal approach to social psychiatry.
