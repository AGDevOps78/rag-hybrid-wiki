These models help to map how actors translate ritual devices into symbolic or therapeutic procedures without presupposing realist–occult claims. Proto-psychologization in harmonial religion For clarity, modern scholarship distinguishes between actors’ metaphysical vocabularies and historians’ analytic categories. In this regard, the article follows the usage of harmonial religion (also called harmonialism) as a historiographical label (etic) designating a North American metaphysical ethos (19th–20th centuries) that links mind–body–spirit harmony to wellbeing, encompassing mind-cure/New Thought, breath culture and related esoteric milieux. The label harmonial religion—part of what Catherine L. Albanese terms the broader American metaphysical religion—was introduced in her study A Republic of Mind and Spirit (2007), while harmonialism is used by Anya P. Foxen to analyse Western reimaginings of yoga, respiration, and their orientalisation. Placed within the wider narrative of Western esotericism and psychology, what Albanese terms harmonial religion (and Foxen discusses as harmonialism)—ranging from Swedenborgian metaphysics through mesmerism, mind-cure and breath culture—constitutes a proto-psychological strand of modern esoteric thought. These formations prefigure the twentieth-century “psychologization of religion” analysed by Wouter J.
