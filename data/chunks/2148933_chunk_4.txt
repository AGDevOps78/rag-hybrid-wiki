The experiences of soldiers at war and coming home inspired psychiatrists to study the epidemiology of mental illness and the factors that exacerbate it. In particular, psychiatrists in the United Kingdom and United States began to study the impact of the environment on mental illness in soldiers and helped usher in the community mental health movement. 'Therapeutic communities' started forming across the UK, and community mental health services for outpatient care grew in number across the United States. In 1946, the United States passed the National Mental Health Act, citing the declining mental health of veterans during World War II. This act provided federal funding for prevention and treatment of mental illness. A direct result of this act was the creation of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1949. NMIH was formed to shift care from psychiatric hospitals to community-based services. === 1950s-1960s === As the community mental health movement gained traction, President John F Kennedy passed the Community Mental Health Act in 1963, which provided $2.9 billion to build community mental health centers across the country.
