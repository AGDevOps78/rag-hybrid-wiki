One difference from solids is that often liquids have charged double layers, and most of the work to date supports that ion transfer (rather than electron) dominates for liquids as first suggested by Irving Langmuir in 1938. All these processes will lead to charges, relatively high electric fields and these in turn can lead to the formation of gaseous ions. ==== Lightning strike ==== In the atmosphere positive and negative charges will accumulate above and below the clouds. One of the most commonly cited ways that charge separation is generated is via the collisions of different forms of solid ice, for instance graupel and ice particles. Similar to the collisions between other types of particles mentioned above, the ice particles become positively charged and the graupel negative. The two have different densities, with the ice particles tending to rise and the graupel fall or move towards the center of the storm. This charge separation in different regions of the clouds leads to large electric fields. When the electric field strength between the cloud and the ground or different parts of a storm exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, discharge will occur and break through the air.
