The study, conducted by two sociologists, one anthropologist, and two psychiatrists, explored the prevalence of mental disorders in urban Midtown Manhattan. This study provided critical evidence of how urban environments impact mental well-being, and emphasized the significance of cultural diversity and social stressors in shaping mental health. It highlighted that social factors like poverty were more influential to mental health compared to simply living in urban environments. ==== Leighton and Murphy's Stirling County study (1948 - present) ==== The Stirling County Study is a longitudinal investigation investigating the social determinants of mental illness in a rural Canadian community. Sociologist and psychiatrist Alexander Leighton and psychiatric epidemiologist Jane Murphy founded the study in 1948, and it is still in effect today. It uses community surveys, interviews, and follow-ups to gather comprehensive data on mental health and social conditions of individuals in the Stirling county community.
