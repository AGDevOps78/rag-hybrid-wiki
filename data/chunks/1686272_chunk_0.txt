Chemical biology is a scientific field at the interface of chemistry and biology that applies chemical methods to the study of biological systems. It involves the use of chemical techniques, analytical approaches, and often small molecules produced through synthetic chemistry to probe, characterize, and manipulate biological processes and systems at the molecular level. Although it overlaps with biochemistry, which focuses on the chemistry of biomolecules and the regulation of biochemical pathways within and between cells, chemical biology is distinguished by its emphasis on the deliberate design and application of chemical tools to address biological questions. == History == Although considered a relatively new scientific field, the term "chemical biology" has been in use since the early 20th century, and has roots in scientific discovery from the early 19th century. The term 'chemical biology' can be traced back to an early appearance in a book published by Alonzo E. Taylor in 1907 titled "On Fermentation", and was subsequently used in John B. Leathes' 1930 article titled "The Harveian Oration on The Birth of Chemical Biology". However, it is unclear when the term was first used.
