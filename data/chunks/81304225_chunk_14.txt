From the 1960s, humanistic workshop cultures and venues such as the Esalen Institute functioned as hubs for experiential methods that framed inner change in strongly symbolic terms. Within these circuits, oracular media and ritualised settings were re-described as vehicles for self-exploration and interpersonal learning, a move that normalised the assimilation of esoteric motifs into therapeutic language without requiring adherence to realist–occult claims. Transpersonal psychology systematised these developments by theorising non-ordinary states and by integrating selected esoteric vocabularies—subtle-body maps, archetypal narratives, and ritualised techniques—into psychological models of development, crisis and integration. Reviews in the field highlight both historical debts to Western esotericism and the need for careful source-tracing to distinguish symbolic/interpretive framings from realist assertions, and to separate genealogy from questions of efficacy. Tradition interfaces in this period Within Analytical psychology, Jungian hermeneutics re-read premodern symbol-systems (notably Alchemy) for psychological theory and practice, while Jungian and allied circles engaged divination corpora (e.g., the I Ching) as symbolic prompts in counselling. Humanistic psychology and workshop cultures (e.g., Esalen Institute) provided experiential containers in which oracular devices and ritualised sequences circulated in interpretive frames. Transpersonal psychology theorised non-ordinary states and integrated selected esoteric vocabularies (subtle-body maps, archetypal language, ritual techniques) into developmental models.
