Lords Spiritual hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. George Carey, made Baron Carey of Clifton the day after he ceased being Archbishop of Canterbury). === Devolved legislatures === The devolved legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have fixed terms. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, these are five years, while in Wales the fixed term is four years. Extraordinary general elections to the devolved legislatures are held if no first minister (or, in the case of Northern Ireland, first minister and deputy first minister) is nominated within a particular period of time, or if two thirds of members of the relevant legislature vote for an extraordinary general election. === Other elected offices === Offices of local government other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years. == United States == === Federal === In the United States, the president of the United States is elected indirectly through the United States Electoral College to a four-year term, with a term limit of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of ten years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1951. The Vice President also serves four-year terms but without any term limit.
