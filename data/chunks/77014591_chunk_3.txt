However, in a rare phenomenon called long-term intense romantic love, intense attraction can remain for much longer than is typical, even for 10 years or more. In contemporary literature, the original characteristics of passionate love are seen to some degree as being a mixture of things. For example, it's been determined that the PLS has questions which measure companionate love, which led Sandra Langeslag and colleagues to develop the Infatuation and Attachment Scales (IAS) as a newer measure of passionate and companionate love. The PLS also measures an obsessional element which is distinguishable in that it's possible to experience love feelings (and even intense attraction) with lower levels of obsession. Finally, while Elaine Hatfield originally described passionate love as having a component of sexual attraction, contemporary authors generally agree that sexual attraction and romantic attraction are distinct. People are motivated to initiate and maintain a pair bond in a way that's different from the sex drive, and it is possible to fall in love in the absence of sexual desire. === Infatuation === Langeslag et al.'s Infatuation Scale (analogous to passionate love) has items asking about: Staring into the distance while thinking of the beloved. Getting shaky knees while in the presence of the beloved.
