At this time in Germany, social psychiatry emphasized protection of the general public of those who are mentally ill and 'antisocial.' ==== United States mental health community movement ==== The mental hygiene movement in the United States marked a shift from individual responsibility of mental health to how public health and society could promote mental health. In 1909, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (now called Mental Health America) was created to focus on mental illness prevention and mental health promotion. In 1915, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene administered a series of social surveys that explored mental illness outside of asylums and institutions. These surveys uncovered the extent of mental health challenges in society, and led to the development of community-based mental hygiene clinics. A psychiatrist, social workers, and a psychologist staffed these clinics, and provided outpatient services and public health and educational initiatives to prevent mental illness. This would later become a key component of the mental health community movement, which influenced the deinstitutionalization era. === 1930s-1940s === Prior to World War II, the majority of research related to social psychiatry focused on the impact of urbanization on serious psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. One of the first social psychiatric studies, 'Mental Disorders in Urban Areas: An Ecological Study of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses', challenged this focus.
