The realistic case will be typically situated in between. By solving the DH equation one can show that diffuse layer potential varies upon approach as ψ ̄ D = 1 1 − p + p tanh ⁡ ( κ h / 2 ) ψ D {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}_{\rm {D}}={\frac {1}{1-p+p\tanh(\kappa h/2)}}\psi _{\rm {D}}} while the surface charged density obey a similar relation σ ̄ = tanh ⁡ ( κ h / 2 ) 1 − p + p tanh ⁡ ( κ h / 2 ) σ {\displaystyle {\bar {\sigma }}={\frac {\tanh(\kappa h/2)}{1-p+p\tanh(\kappa h/2)}}\sigma } The swelling pressure can be found by inserting the exact solution of the DH equation into the expressions above and one finds Π = 2 ε ε 0 κ 2 ψ D 2 e − κ h [ 1 + ( 1 − 2 p ) e − κ h ] 2 {\displaystyle \Pi =2\epsilon \epsilon _{0}\kappa ^{2}\psi _{\rm {D}}^{2}{\frac {e^{-\kappa h}}{[1+(1-2p)e^{-\kappa h}]^{2}}}} Repulsion is strongest for the CC conditions (p = 1) while it is weaker for the CP conditions (p = 0). The result of the superposition approximation is always recovered at larger distances but also for p = 1/2 at all distances. The latter fact explains why the superposition approximation can be very accurate even at small separations. Surfaces regulate their charge and not infrequently the actual regulation parameter is not far away from 1/2. The situation is exemplified in the figure below. From stability considerations one can show that p < 1 and that this parameter may also becomes negative. These results can be extended to asymmetric case in a straightforward way.
