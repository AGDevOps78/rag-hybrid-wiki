== Generation mechanism == Various negative air ions are formed by combining active neutral molecules and electrons in the gas through a series of ion-molecule reactions. In the air, due to the presence of many water molecules, the negative air ions typically combine with water to form hydrated negative air ions, such as O−·(H2O)n, O2−·(H2O)n, O3−·(H2O)n, OH−·(H2O)n, CO3−·(H2O)n, HCO3−·(H2O)n, CO4−·(H2O)n, NO2−·(H2O)n, NO3−·(H2O)n, etc. The ion clusters formed by the combination of small ions and water molecules have a longer survival period due to their large volume and the fact that the charge is protected by water molecules and is not easy to transfer. This is because in the molecular collision, the larger the molecular volume, the less energy is lost when encountering collisions with other molecules, thereby extending the survival time of negative air ions. == Generation methods == Negative air ions can be produced by two methods: natural or artificial. The methods of producing negative air ions in nature include the waterfall effect, lightning ionization and from plants. Natural methods can produce a large number of negative air ions. The artificial means of producing negative air ions include corona discharge and water vapour.
