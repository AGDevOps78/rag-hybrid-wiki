A widely used componential definition was formulated by the historian of religion Antoine Faivre, who identified four intrinsic features—(1) correspondences linking microcosm and macrocosm, (2) a living nature open to hidden forces, (3) the primacy of imagination and mediations (e.g., images, symbols, rites), and (4) transmutation (psychic or spiritual transformation)—together with two relative traits, (5) concordance among traditions and (6) transmission (initiatory or doctrinal). Hanegraaff’s overviews present this scheme as a heuristic for describing modern formations rather than as an ontology. In this article, psychology is used broadly to cover three overlapping domains: (a) theoretical systems (e.g., Jungian and archetypal psychology), (b) clinical and para-clinical modalities (e.g., hypnosis, psychotherapy, arts-based and anthroposophic therapies), and (c) popular psychological culture and coaching in which esoteric repertoires are translated into symbolic–psychological idioms or embedded as operative frameworks. === Extent and limits === The temporal focus is modern–contemporary, from late eighteenth-century mesmerism to the present. Medieval and Renaissance entanglements (e.g., Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Christian Kabbalah) provide background but are not the primary focus. The emphasis falls on channels by which esoteric repertoires (alchemy, astrology, and subtle-body schemes such as “chakras”) entered psychological theory, therapy, and self-work. Purely devotional mysticism (union without operative correspondences) is distinguished from esotericism; by contrast, secular mind–body programmes without esoteric genealogy (e.g., standardized MBSR) are treated as contrasts rather than instances. === Methodological cautions === Consistent with the academic study of Western esotericism, the article distinguishes actors’ emic self-descriptions from scholarly etic analysis.
