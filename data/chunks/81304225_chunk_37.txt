Earlier Western harmonial and breath-culture traditions (see Popular psychology and coaching) already framed breathing and relaxation as psychophysical techniques linking mind–body regulation and esoteric ideas of vital influx. === Energy-themed practices (subtle-body framings) === Under “energy” labels (e.g., reiki, “healing touch”, pranic variants), late-modern counselling and coaching milieus sometimes redeploy subtle-body vocabularies from Western esoteric and hybrid Asian-Western repertoires. In such settings, techniques are framed interpretively—as symbolic scaffolds for attention, meaning-making and regulation—or, in some complementary/alternative medicine contexts, as putative causal interventions. Scholarly accounts treat these as boundary phenomena of diffusion (occulture, workshop economies) and urge analytic separation between provenance (subtle-body genealogies) and evidential claims about outcomes. In practice these offerings often co-occur with body–attention formats (e.g., yoga-based sessions); here they are treated separately because “energy” labels involve subtle-body vocabularies and, in some contexts, putative causal claims that go beyond symbolic/physiological framings. === Past-life regressions and “Akashic” narrative work (boundary uses) === Some counselling and coaching niches redeploy theosophical vocabularies—e.g., Akashic records channeling or use past life regressions and related narratives as frames for meaning-making and personal storytelling. In such settings, practitioners may bracket cosmological truth-claims and present sessions as symbolic prompts; in others, realist assertions are made. Historians treat these as cases of late-modern diffusion (occulture) of esoteric repertoires into self-work, while transpersonal commentators emphasise keeping genealogical description distinct from evidential claims and separating workshop formats from clinical protocols.
