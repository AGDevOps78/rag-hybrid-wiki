Energy-labelled offerings (reiki-style sessions, “healing touch”, pranic variants) sit at the boundary of the field: critics question proposed subtle-energy mechanisms and call for higher-quality trials, while proponents and detractors dispute both mechanisms and effect sizes; the article therefore reports such practices as diffusion phenomena (occulture/workshop economies) and urges explicit separation between complementary uses and clinical claims. Boundary-field literatures such as parapsychology—evolving from nineteenth-century psychical research into laboratory and survey programmes on anomalous cognition (e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance)—are treated here as historical interfaces with psychology rather than as psychological schools; claims are reported with attribution and kept analytically distinct from genealogical description and from clinical efficacy appraisals. Likewise, narrative formats such as past-life or “Akashic” consultations are presented as boundary phenomena of diffusion; symbolic/interpretive framings are distinguished from realist claims. Safety and scope-of-practice concerns are most salient where non-ordinary states or strong catharsis are involved. Scholarly and clinical discussions converge on screening for vulnerability; clear preparation and integration phases; monitoring for dissociation or destabilisation; explicit consent about symbolic versus doctrinal framings; and robust referral pathways when indicated. In symbolic counselling and oracular work, ethical guidance stresses non-directive framing and avoidance of deterministic claims. More generally, hybrid settings benefit from transparent consent about interpretive status, clear separation between educational/experiential workshops and clinical treatment, and caution against conflating cultural vigency with evidential support. == See also == Western esotericism and science Western esotericism and the arts Analytical psychology Transpersonal psychology Cognitive science of religion Neuroscience of religion Scholarly approaches to mysticism == References == == Bibliography == Faivre, Antoine; Needleman, Jacob, eds.
