Oracular media (tarot, astrology, I Ching) were redeployed as projective devices in symbolic counselling, while psychological receptions of astrology articulated a counselling idiom distinct from divinatory epistemologies. Contemporary treatments of (Hermetic) Kabbalah adapted diagrammatic grammars (e.g., the Tree of Life) to popular self-development, illustrating how esoteric repertoires circulate through publishing, courses and retreat cultures. Institutional and editorial hubs in this period Degree and certificate programmes under “contemplative” or “integrative” banners—such as those at Naropa University and the California Institute of Integral Studies—institutionalised translations of Asian and esoteric repertoires into educational and para-clinical formats alongside humanistic and transpersonal frameworks. Retreat centres and training networks scaled delivery through workshops and certifications, while publishing series oriented to spirituality–psychology and practical symbolism supported diffusion into counselling, education and coaching. Historians analyse these developments under late-modern occulture and market logics rather than as extensions of academic psychology proper. ==== New religious movements and diffusion ==== Scholars of new religious movements (NRMs) have noted that several conduits linking esoteric repertoires to popular psychological culture ran through movement contexts—e.g., Theosophy, Anthroposophy, Spiritism and, in late modernity, the heterogeneous networks often labelled “New Age” (a label related with the esoteric belief in an astrological Age of Aquarius, although not every idea or movement labeled as New Age actually holds this belief). Rather than a single denomination, the New Age milieu functioned as a loose market of workshops, retreats and publishing that recycled and recombined esoteric materials with psychologized self-cultivation and therapeutic language. Sociological models describe this circulation in terms of a “cultic milieu”, in which heterodox ideas—astrology, subtle-body schemes, trance techniques—persist and periodically reappear in new guises; Partridge’s notion of “occulture” further captures how such repertoires permeate popular culture beyond formal religion.
