Drawing variously on Jungian symbolism, Reichian somatic therapy, and the holistic philosophy of humanistic and transpersonal psychology, their founders framed movement, voice, and enactment as means of catharsis, integration, and energetic balance. Although later professionalised in clinical and educational contexts, historians of psychology trace their conceptual origins to the spiritual humanism and vitalist cosmologies that characterised the broader Western esoteric revival. Within these hybrid workshop cultures, ritualised movement and dramatic role-play were interpreted through the languages of affect regulation, meaning-making, and embodied insight—continuing the psychologisation of esoteric repertoires within the broader human potential and transpersonal milieu. In parallel, other twentieth-century movements systematised body-based psychotherapies into formal schools, bridging somatic, energetic, and expressive paradigms. ==== Visual and imaginal practices (colour/diagram work) ==== Beyond formal art therapies, workshop and counselling milieus influenced by Jungian and esoteric repertoires have redeployed imaginal and diagrammatic devices—e.g., drawing or colouring mandalas; colour sequences mapped to subtle-body grammars; reflective composition around emblematic images—as structured prompts for narrative, value-clarification and self-regulation. In these uses, premodern diagrams and colour codings function as symbolic scaffolds rather than doctrinal claims, illustrating how arts-based exercises circulate across clinical, para-clinical and coaching settings under interpretive (non-realist) frames. === Sound-based practices === Sound-focused sessions—e.g., singing bowls and gong baths—are often framed through Pythagorean and (neo)hermetic (The Kybalion) narratives of hidden vibration and cosmic harmony (a Western esoteric lineage) while being presented with Asian aesthetics or branding (“Tibetan bowls”) in late-modern wellness markets. A parallel, secular rationale describes these formats as aids to relaxation, attentional focus and group containment.
