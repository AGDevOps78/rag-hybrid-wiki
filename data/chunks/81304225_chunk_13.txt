A concurrent American strand, New Thought, articulated mental-causation vocabularies that later informed self-help and coaching; historians situate this diffusion within late-modern occulture and the psychologization of religion. Institutional and editorial hubs in this period The Theosophical Society and its publishing arms (e.g., Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar) disseminated handbooks and plates of subtle-body/chakra schemes for non-initiatory audiences, while anthroposophic centres around the Goetheanum (Dornach) developed pedagogical and para-clinical programmes that integrated symbolic movement and arts therapies. Lecture circuits and comparative-religion forums linked erudite synthesis with psychological hermeneutics, helping to normalise interpretive (non-realist) uses of esoteric materials in counselling and education. === Twentieth century: analytical, humanistic and transpersonal === In the early to mid-twentieth century, approaches associated with Analytical psychology developed sustained hermeneutics of premodern symbol-systems—most prominently Alchemy—as resources for psychological theory and practice, with Active imagination and mandala work translating symbolic repertoires into models of psychic transformation and individuation. Comparative engagements (including dialogues around classical divination texts such as the I Ching) encouraged a broader reception of esoteric imagery in counselling milieus. Within this framework, Carl Jung’s notion of synchronicity (“an acausal connecting principle”) underwrote interpretive uses of divinatory media—such as the I Ching—in counselling settings, framing them as structured prompts for meaning-making rather than as vehicles of predictive knowledge. From the 1960s, humanistic workshop cultures and venues such as the Esalen Institute functioned as hubs for experiential methods that framed inner change in strongly symbolic terms. Within these circuits, oracular media and ritualised settings were re-described as vehicles for self-exploration and interpersonal learning, a move that normalised the assimilation of esoteric motifs into therapeutic language without requiring adherence to realist–occult claims.
