Under banners such as Eurythmy and arts-based therapeutic work, anthroposophic centres and clinics—organised around hubs like the Goetheanum—framed symbolic movement and creative exercises as instruments for well-being, rehabilitation or education, sometimes alongside subtle-body explanations and sometimes within secular pedagogical vocabularies. These programmes illustrate a pathway by which modern occultist repertoires entered educational and therapeutic niches: ritualised movement, diagrammatic grammars and guided imagination were re-coded as techniques for development and regulation in schoolrooms, clinics and workshops. Historians treat the linkage between doctrine, pedagogy and para-clinical arts as a key channel of diffusion from esoteric milieus to psychological language, while maintaining a clear analytic separation between provenance and empirical claims about efficacy or safety. === Hypnosis and brief therapies === From nineteenth-century mesmerism and guided somnambulism to medical hypnosis and later brief, strategic or indirect approaches, trance work provides a through-line connecting esoteric repertoires and psychological technique. What began as claims about invisible “fluids” and mediumistic channels was re-coded in medical and psychological vocabularies as suggestion, attentional focusing and communicative framing; staged demonstrations and clinical case series helped normalise descriptive languages for trance phenomena and dissociation. In contemporary practice, indirect and narrative methods (often associated with Ericksonian influence) treat images, metaphors and ritualised sequences as devices for re-patterning experience without realist–occult commitments. === Neoshamanisms and related practices === Late twentieth-century neoshamanic currents adapted drumming, “journeying” and small-scale ritual dramaturgy into workshop formats oriented toward self-knowledge, counselling or group learning. In many cases—e.g., the approach popularised by Michael Harner—realist–occult claims were downplayed in favour of symbolic or psychagogic framings, yet the borrowing of esoteric vocabularies and techniques remained evident.
