Philosophy itself, having withdrawn from claims of the natural world cemented by the rise of empiricism in the Enlightenment Era, instead focused further on criticism of both its way of "knowing" knowledge as well as other disciplines' claims on knowledge or epistemology. Because of this, the history of sociology and philosophy is a pattern of toing and froing, of each examining the other alongside interdisciplinary explorations that intersect them both. Sociology of philosophy, as an empirical sociological branch based on theory, was developed in the 1980s. == References ==
