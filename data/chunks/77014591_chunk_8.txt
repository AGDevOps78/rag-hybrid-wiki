These authors (Acevedo & Aron, Graham) have speculated that continued romantic obsession within a relationship could be connected to attachment style. Attachment style refers to differences in attachment-related thoughts and behaviors, especially relating to the concept of security vs. insecurity. This can be split into components of anxiety (worrying the partner is available, attentive and responsive) and avoidance (preference not to rely on others or open up emotionally). It has been suggested that attachment style forms during childhood and adolescence, but twin studies have also suggested a heritable component, and attachment anxiety is correlated with the personality trait neuroticism. People can also have different attachment styles with different partners, for example an avoidant partner can cause a secure partner to feel and act anxious. === Positive illusions === Idealization (perceiving the beloved in the most positive way, or overlooking their faults) is a form of positive illusions. A 1996 study of couples who had been dating for 19 months and couples who had been married for 6.5 years found that "Individuals were happier in their relationships when they idealized their partners and their partners idealized them." A brain scan experiment also found that couples who were still in love after four years (as compared to those who weren't) showed activation in a region associated with suspending negative judgment and over-evaluating a partner.
