By shifting the focus from individual pathology to the social context, community-based care promotes recovery, reduces stigma, and improves overall well-being. Community-based care offers a range of services, including early intervention, crisis intervention, medication management, therapy, and rehabilitation. These services are delivered in various settings, such as clinics, schools, workplaces, and community centers. By providing accessible and culturally competent care, community-based programs aim to reduce disparities in mental health care and improve outcomes for individuals with mental illness. These programs often involve collaboration between healthcare providers, social workers, educators, and community members to create supportive environments and empower individuals to build resilience. === Cultural norms, values, and beliefs === Social psychiatry acknowledges that cultural norms, values, and beliefs shape the expression, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses. This perspective advocates for culturally competent care to adjust for biases in psychiatry and public health services. In this sense, social psychiatry mirrors cultural psychiatry by emphasizing how mental illnesses and psychiatric disorders vary across cultural contexts.
