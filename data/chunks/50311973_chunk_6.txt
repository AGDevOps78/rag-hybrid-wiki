=== Microfluidic cell culture === Microfluidic devices make possible the study of a single cell to a few hundred cells in a 3D environment. Comparatively, macroscopic 2D cultures have 104 to 107 cells on a flat surface. Microfluidics also allow for chemical gradients, the continuous flow of fresh media, high through put testing, and direct output to analytical instruments. Additionally, open microfluidic cell cultures such as "microcanals" allow for direct physical manipulation of cells with micropipettes. Many microfluidic systems employ the use of hydrogels as the extracellular matrix (ECM) support which can be modulated for fiber thickness and pore size and have been demonstrated to allow the growth of cancer cells. Gel free 3D cell cultures have been developed to allow cells to grow in either a cell dense environment or an ECM poor environment. Although these devices have proven very useful, there are certain disadvantages such as cells sticking to the PDMS surface, small molecules diffusing into the PDMS, and unreacted PDMS polymers washing into cell culture media. The use of 3D cell cultures in microfluidic devices has led to a field of study called organ-on-a-chip.
