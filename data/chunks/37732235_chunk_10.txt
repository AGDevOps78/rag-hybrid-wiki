On the other hand, when the surface potential is kept constant, one refers to constant potential (CP) boundary condition. In this case, the surface charge density decreases upon approach. Such decrease of charge can be caused by adsorption of desorption of charged ions from the surface. Such variation of adsorbed species upon approach has also been referred to as proximal adsorption. The ability of the surface to regulate its charge can be quantified by the regulation parameter p = C D C I + C D {\displaystyle p={\frac {C_{\rm {D}}}{C_{\rm {I}}+C_{\rm {D}}}}} where CD = ε0 ε κ is the diffuse layer capacitance and CI the inner (or regulation) capacitance. The CC conditions are found when p = 1 while the CP conditions for p = 0. The realistic case will be typically situated in between. By solving the DH equation one can show that diffuse layer potential varies upon approach as ψ ̄ D = 1 1 − p + p tanh ⁡ ( κ h / 2 ) ψ D {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}_{\rm {D}}={\frac {1}{1-p+p\tanh(\kappa h/2)}}\psi _{\rm {D}}} while the surface charged density obey a similar relation σ ̄ = tanh ⁡ ( κ h / 2 ) 1 − p + p tanh ⁡ ( κ h / 2 ) σ {\displaystyle {\bar {\sigma }}={\frac {\tanh(\kappa h/2)}{1-p+p\tanh(\kappa h/2)}}\sigma } The swelling pressure can be found by inserting the exact solution of the DH equation into the expressions above and one finds Π = 2 ε ε 0 κ 2 ψ D 2 e − κ h [ 1 + ( 1 − 2 p ) e − κ h ] 2 {\displaystyle \Pi =2\epsilon \epsilon _{0}\kappa ^{2}\psi _{\rm {D}}^{2}{\frac {e^{-\kappa h}}{[1+(1-2p)e^{-\kappa h}]^{2}}}} Repulsion is strongest for the CC conditions (p = 1) while it is weaker for the CP conditions (p = 0).
