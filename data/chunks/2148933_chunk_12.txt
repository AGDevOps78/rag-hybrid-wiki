Conversely, stable and affordable housing provides psychological safety, fostering a sense of control and security that protects mental well-being. ==== Poverty ==== Social psychiatry views poverty as a critical determinant of mental health, emphasizing its role in creating chronic stress, limited access to resources, and systemic barriers to care. Research has shown that these barriers can generate psychological distress and increase vulnerability to conditions like depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Poverty often leads to social isolation, a key topic in social psychiatry. Faris and Dunham's 1939 study was among the first to identify social isolation as a determinant to mental health. Children in poverty, social psychiatry argues, can have developmental impacts and are associated with higher risk for adverse mental health outcomes. In the medical community, poverty is considered an Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE). ==== Class and socioeconomic status ==== Social psychiatry examines class and socioeconomic status (SES) as factors that shape mental health by influencing access to power, privilege, and resources.
