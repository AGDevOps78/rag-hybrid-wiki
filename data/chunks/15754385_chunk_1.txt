(...) and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust them out among the artisans or the farmers. And again, if from these there is born a son with unexpected gold or silver in his composition they shall honor such and bid them go up higher, some to the office of guardian, some to the assistanceship, alleging that there is an oracle that the state shall then be overthrown when the man of iron or brass is its guardian. In Republic Book III, 415a–417b, Plato (or Socrates within the dialogue) seeks not merely to justify the social hierarchy through the "noble lie", but also to devise a means of preventing intensified hostility between classes and harmoniously binding different strata together, by ensuring that each class exchanges its shares and roles and that these are distributed in a balanced way. In Plato’s Republic, the “gold of the soul” does not refer to an actual metal, but rather to the nobility residing within the guardian’s inner nature. By contrast, the “gold of the earth” signifies material wealth, portrayed as a source of envy, greed, intrigue, and corruption. Accordingly, he argues that the ruling and producing classes must possess different qualifications. The ruling class, endowed with the virtues likened to “gold and silver” in the soul, should therefore be excluded from the economic qualification to accumulate worldly wealth. The producing class, by contrast, possesses a temperament likened to “bronze” and thus may form and exchange wealth and property, but must be barred from participation in politics.
