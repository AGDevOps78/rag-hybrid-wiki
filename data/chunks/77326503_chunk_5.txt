This charge separation in different regions of the clouds leads to large electric fields. When the electric field strength between the cloud and the ground or different parts of a storm exceeds the dielectric strength of the air, discharge will occur and break through the air. During the lightning discharge process, charged particles bombard the surrounding air molecules, ionizing the molecules to generate negative air ions. At the moment of the lightning strike, hundreds of millions of negative air ions will be generated. ==== Plant discharge ==== The leaves of vegetation, particularly indoor plants can lead to ions. The rate is low, can be increased by applying electric fields and there are indications that it can be enhanced at the tips of leaves although there are also physiological factors. The light exposure conditions also play a role, with an exponential dependence on the illumination intensity. Bioreactor have been explored which can produce levels of ions that could be useful for reducing particular contaminants.
