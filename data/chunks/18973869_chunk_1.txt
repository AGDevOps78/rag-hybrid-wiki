The fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in May 2013. However, its release coincided with a statement by then-NIMH Director Thomas Insel noting that the manual lacks validity compared to other medical specialties due to the absence of objective laboratory measures (biomarkers) for diagnosis. Treatment may include psychotropics (psychiatric medicines), psychotherapy, substance-abuse treatment, and other modalities such as interventional approaches, assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or risk to the individual or community. Research within psychiatry is conducted by psychiatrists on an interdisciplinary basis with other professionals, including clinical psychologists, epidemiologists, nurses, social workers, and occupational therapists. Psychiatry has been controversial since its inception, facing criticism both internally and externally over its medicalization of mental distress, reliance on pharmaceuticals, use of coercion, influence from the pharmaceutical industry, and its historical role in social control and contentious treatments. Due to the absence of objective biological pathology (such as tissue damage or biomarkers), prominent critics such as Thomas Szasz and Peter Breggin have characterized the field as a pseudoscience or a form of social control masquerading as medicine. Additionally, the 'chemical imbalance' theory used to market psychiatric drugs for decades was recently identified as empirically unsubstantiated by a major 2022 review, leading to accusations of systemic pharmaceutical marketing fraud.
