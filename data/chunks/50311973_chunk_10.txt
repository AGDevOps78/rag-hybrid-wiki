developed a 25x75 mm, easily accessible microfluidic device. This design is used to optimize the conditions by changing well diameters, UV light exposure (causing mutagenesis), and light/no light tests for culturing Botryococcus braunii, which is one of the most common freshwater microalgae for biofuel production. ==== Bacteria and yeast ==== Microfluidic systems can be used to incubate high volumes of bacteria and yeast colonies. The two-layer microchemostat device is made to allow scientists to culture cells under chemostatic and thermostatic conditions without moving cells around and causing intercellular interaction. Yeast cell suspension droplets can be placed on a plate with patterned hydrophilic areas and incubated for 24 hours; then the droplets are split the produced proteins from yeast are analyzed by MALDI-MS without killing the cells in the original droplets. == Multi-culture in microfluidics == Compared to the highly complex microenvironment in vivo, traditional mono-culture of single cell types in vitro only provides limited information about cellular behavior due to the lack of interactions with other cell types. Typically, cell-to-cell signaling can be divided into four categories depending on the distance: endocrine signaling, paracrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and juxtacrine signaling. For example, in paracrine signaling, growth factors secreted from one cell diffuse over a short distance to the neighboring target cell, whereas in juxtacrine signaling, membrane-bound ligands of one cell directly bind to surface receptors of adjacent cells.
