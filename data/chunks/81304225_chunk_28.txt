Among late-1960s self-help and human potential offerings, José Silva’s Silva Method (originally “Silva Mind Control”) packaged relaxation/auto-hypnosis and guided imagery— including exercises with “inner guides” (imaginal counselors)—together with the era’s alpha-training discourse and New Thought-style autosuggestion, while also invoking elements of ESP in a parapsychological key. Reference works place the program in the self-religion/auto-help milieu rather than clinical psychotherapy and note Silva’s autodidactic background (psychology, yoga, modern Rosicrucian doctrines) and the model’s international diffusion via seminars and books. A second conduit was personality typing. The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), inspired by Jungian typology, achieved wide uptake in education, management and pastoral guidance despite sustained methodological criticism concerning reliability, temporal stability of “types” and predictive validity; overviews recommend caution regarding its use for selection or diagnosis. By contrast, the modern Enneagram took shape in late twentieth-century esoteric–therapeutic milieus (e.g., Oscar Ichazo's system and later adaptations by Claudio Naranjo), before diffusing into counselling and coaching; academic surveys emphasise its recent genealogy, heterogeneous evidence base and cultural vigency rather than established efficacy. Communication-focused packages—commonly grouped under NLP—combined elements from humanistic psychotherapy, Ericksonian communication and popular linguistics to offer toolkits for persuasion, reframing and self-change. While not esoteric in doctrine, such programmes circulated in the same workshop economies as symbolic counselling and energy-themed practices, and at times repackaged esoteric maps (archetypes, “energy”, transformation) in optimisation language. Systematic reviews report insufficient evidence for robust effects and note pervasive methodological limitations.
