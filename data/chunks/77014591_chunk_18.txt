Sandra Langeslag notes that it's a common misconception that love feelings are uncontrollable, or even should not be controlled; however studies have shown that love regulation is possible and may be useful. For example, looking at pictures of the beloved has been shown to increase feelings of infatuation (i.e. passionate love) and attachment (i.e. companionate love). In another technique called cognitive reappraisal, one focuses on positive or negative aspects of the beloved, the relationship, or imagined future scenarios: In negative reappraisal, one focuses on negative qualities of the beloved ("he's lazy", "she's always late"), the relationship ("we fight a lot") or imagined future scenarios ("he'll cheat on me"). Negative reappraisal decreases feelings of infatuation and attachment, but decreases mood in the short term. Langeslag has recommended distraction as an antidote to the short-term decrease in mood. Negative reappraisal can be useful, for example, to those who want to ameliorate heartbreak or put an end to an abusive relationship.
