=== 1930s-1940s === Prior to World War II, the majority of research related to social psychiatry focused on the impact of urbanization on serious psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia. One of the first social psychiatric studies, 'Mental Disorders in Urban Areas: An Ecological Study of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses', challenged this focus. The study, published in 1939 by University of Chicago sociologists Robert Faris and Warren Dunham, applied a social sciences methodological approach to the study of mental illness. Their findings introduced the concept of social isolation and poverty as factors in mental illness, when existing research had primarily focused on urban versus rural environments. This study captured the attention of United States politicians and policy officials and helped usher in a wave of policy reforms in the coming years. ==== World War II ==== Social psychiatry turned its focus to veteran mental health as a result of World War II. The experiences of soldiers at war and coming home inspired psychiatrists to study the epidemiology of mental illness and the factors that exacerbate it. In particular, psychiatrists in the United Kingdom and United States began to study the impact of the environment on mental illness in soldiers and helped usher in the community mental health movement.
