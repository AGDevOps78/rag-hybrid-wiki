In such settings, practitioners may bracket cosmological truth-claims and present sessions as symbolic prompts; in others, realist assertions are made. Historians treat these as cases of late-modern diffusion (occulture) of esoteric repertoires into self-work, while transpersonal commentators emphasise keeping genealogical description distinct from evidential claims and separating workshop formats from clinical protocols. === Cross-cutting uptake in clinical and coaching settings === Across these devices, adoption in psychotherapy, counselling and coaching often proceeds under interpretive (symbolic) framings that bracket cosmological truth-claims. Reported benefits—when present—are frequently interpreted in terms of common factors (working alliance, expectancy, meaning response) and the structuring of attention and emotion by bounded settings (ritual sequence, symbolic media, group containment). Cultural visibility in workshop and wellness markets is documented by sociological accounts of late-modern occulture and the cultic milieu, but such visibility is kept analytically distinct from clinical validation. == Evidence, risks, and debates == This article separates questions of provenance from questions of efficacy. Genealogical links to esoteric repertoires do not in themselves predict outcomes; conversely, cultural visibility in wellness or coaching markets does not constitute clinical validation. Reviews at the psychology–religion interface therefore recommend keeping source-tracing distinct from empirical appraisal and maintaining clarity between symbolic/interpretive framings and realist–occult assertions.
