Samsung marketed its Galaxy Z Flip as featuring 30 μm (0.0012 in)-thick "ultra-thin glass" with a plastic layer similar to the Galaxy Fold, manufactured by Samsung with materials from Schott AG, which is "produced using an intensifying process to enhance its flexibility and durability", and injected with a "special material up to an undisclosed depth to achieve a consistent hardness". A stress test by YouTube channel JerryRigEverything showed the screen was scratched when rubbed with a pick with a Mohs rating of 2 (in comparison, most smartphones tested by the channel begin to experience scratches with 6 and 7-rated picks), placing its durability in line with other folding phones. However, The Verge did note Samsung's statement that the device contained a protective polymer layer similar to that of the Galaxy Fold. == List of foldable smartphone manufacturers == Google Honor Huawei Infinix Motorola OnePlus OPPO Samsung Vivo Xiaomi ZTE Tecno Royole Nubia == See also == Telephones portal Clamshell design Dual-touchscreen Flexible display Form factor (mobile phones) Laptop == References ==
