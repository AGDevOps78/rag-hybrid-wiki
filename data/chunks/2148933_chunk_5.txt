NMIH was formed to shift care from psychiatric hospitals to community-based services. === 1950s-1960s === As the community mental health movement gained traction, President John F Kennedy passed the Community Mental Health Act in 1963, which provided $2.9 billion to build community mental health centers across the country. This ushered in the deinstitutionalization era, which marked widespread closure of state psychiatric hospitals in favor of community mental health services. Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, declared in his State of the Union in 1964, further advanced social psychiatry in United States public policy. It justified more spending on social welfare programs and community mental health centers. However, its focus on the 'culture of poverty' rather than poverty itself led to criticism among social scientists and psychiatrists. == The decline of social psychiatry == The shifting terrain of American politics impacted the influence of social psychiatry at a national level.
