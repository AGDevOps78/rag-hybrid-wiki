Let us only discuss the symmetric situation within the DH model here. This discussion will introduce the notion of charge regulation, which suggests that the surface charge (and the surface potential) may vary (or regulate) upon approach. The DH equation can be solved exactly for two plates. The boundary conditions play an important role, and the surface potential and surface charge density ψ ̄ D {\displaystyle {\bar {\psi }}_{\rm {D}}} and σ ̄ {\displaystyle {\bar {\sigma }}} become functions of the surface separation h and they may differ from the corresponding quantities ψD and σ for the isolated surface. When the surface charge remains constant upon approach, one refers to the constant charge (CC) boundary conditions. In this case, the diffuse layer potential will increase upon approach. On the other hand, when the surface potential is kept constant, one refers to constant potential (CP) boundary condition. In this case, the surface charge density decreases upon approach.
