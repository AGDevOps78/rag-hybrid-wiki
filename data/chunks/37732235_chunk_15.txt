When the non-uniformities are arranged in a quadratic lattice with spacing b, the decay length q−1 of this additional attraction can be expressed as q 2 = κ 2 + ( 2 π b ) 2 {\displaystyle q^{2}=\kappa ^{2}+\left({\frac {2\pi }{b}}\right)^{2}} At high salt levels, this attraction is screened as the interaction between uniformly charged surfaces. At lower salt levels, however, the range of this attraction is related to the characteristic size of the surface charge heterogeneities. Three-body forces: The interactions between weakly charged objects are pair-wise additive due to the linear nature of the DH approximation. On the PB level, however, attractive three-body forces are present. The interaction free energy between three objects 1, 2, and 3 can be expressed as F 123 = F 12 + F 12 + F 12 + Δ F 123 {\displaystyle F_{123}=F_{12}+F_{12}+F_{12}+\Delta F_{123}} where Fij are the pair free energies and ΔF123 is the non-additive three-body contribution. These three-body contributions were found to be attractive on the PB level, meaning that three charged objects repel less strongly than what one would expect on the basis of pair-wise interactions alone. == Beyond Poisson-Boltzmann approximation == More accurate description of double layer interactions can be put forward on the primitive model. This model treats the electrostatic and hard-core interactions between all individual ions explicitly.
