=== Neoshamanisms and related practices === Late twentieth-century neoshamanic currents adapted drumming, “journeying” and small-scale ritual dramaturgy into workshop formats oriented toward self-knowledge, counselling or group learning. In many cases—e.g., the approach popularised by Michael Harner—realist–occult claims were downplayed in favour of symbolic or psychagogic framings, yet the borrowing of esoteric vocabularies and techniques remained evident. These translations illustrate how ritual devices (rhythm, guided imagination, role-work, structured closure) can migrate into psychological idioms while cosmological truth-claims are bracketed. === Communication-based approaches (NLP and related packages) === Communication-centred trainings—often grouped under NLP and allied packages—combined elements from humanistic psychotherapy, Ericksonian communication and popular linguistics to offer pragmatic toolkits for persuasion, reframing and self-change. While not esoteric in doctrine, these programmes circulated in the same workshop economies as symbolic counselling and energy-themed practices, and at times repackaged esoteric maps in personal optimisation language (archetypes, “energy”, transformation). Scholarly treatments emphasise the distinction between genealogical proximity to esoteric repertoires and empirical evaluation of outcomes, urging clear separation between provenance and evidential claims. === Parapsychology (boundary-field interface) === Nineteenth-century psychical research evolved into twentieth-century parapsychology, which pursued experimental and survey studies of anomalous cognition (e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance) at the boundary of psychology proper. In this article parapsychology is treated as a historical interface with psychology—linked to case-genres on automatism and dissociation and intersecting selectively with transpersonal psychology debates on non-ordinary states—rather than as a psychological school; genealogical description is kept distinct from evidential claims.
