== Application of negative air ions == === Environmental improvement === Negative air ions are a component of electrostatic filters which are used to remove dust and particulate pollutants (PM) both in industry and for indoor pollutants. One area that has been studied is the use of a corona-negative ions generator in experiments on particles sedimentation through three steps: charging, migration, and sedimentation. It has been found that charged PM will settle faster or sink faster under the action of gravity so that PM will settle/precipitate faster than uncharged PM. In addition, experimental studies have shown that negative air ions have a specific degradation effect on chloroform, toluene, and 1,5-Hexadiene and produce carbon dioxide and water as final products through chemical reactions. === Negative ion therapy === Negative air ionization therapy uses air ionisers as a non-pharmaceutical treatment for respiratory disease, allergy, or stress-related health conditions. As a preventative approach to help reduce pollutants as described above they have a role. In addition to this there are claims that they have a very specific role by themselves, with many articles on this in the popular science literature. However, detailed reviews ot the evidence indicates that many of these treatments using NAIs have minimal demonstrated heath benefits.
