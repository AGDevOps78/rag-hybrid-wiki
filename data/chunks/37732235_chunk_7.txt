The potential at the midplane is thus given by twice the value of this potential at a distance z = h/2. The disjoining pressure becomes Π = 2 ε ε 0 κ 2 ψ D 2 e − κ h {\displaystyle \Pi =2\epsilon \epsilon _{0}\kappa ^{2}\psi _{\rm {D}}^{2}e^{-\kappa h}} The electrostatic double layer force decays in an exponential fashion. Due to the screening by the electrolyte, the range of the force is given by the Debye length and its strength by the surface potential (or surface charge density). This approximation turns out to be exact provided the plate-plate separation is large compared to the Debye length and the surface potentials are low. This result can be simply generalized to highly charged surfaces, but only at larger separations. Even if the potential is large close to the surface, it will be small at larger distances, and can be described by the DH equation. However, in this case one has to replace the actual diffuse layer potential ψD with the effective potential ψeff. Within the PB model, this effective potential can be evaluated analytically, and reads ψ e f f = 4 β q tanh ⁡ ( β q ψ D ) {\displaystyle \psi _{\rm {eff}}={\frac {4}{\beta q}}\tanh(\beta q\psi _{\rm {D}})} The superposition approximation can be easily extended to asymmetric systems.
