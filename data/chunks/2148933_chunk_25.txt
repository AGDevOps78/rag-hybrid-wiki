Sociologist and psychiatrist Alexander Leighton and psychiatric epidemiologist Jane Murphy founded the study in 1948, and it is still in effect today. It uses community surveys, interviews, and follow-ups to gather comprehensive data on mental health and social conditions of individuals in the Stirling county community. The long-term nature of this study provided valuable insights for social psychiatry by demonstrating that mental illness did exist in rural communities, not just urban ones. The study revealed that mental illness rates were significantly influenced by social factors, including economic deprivation, social isolation, and family dynamics. Its long-term perspective provided insights into how changing social and economic conditions affect mental health over time. This research also highlighted the unique challenges of mental health in rural settings and helped influence the community mental health center movement. == Current work == Social psychiatry can be most effectively applied in helping to develop mental health promotion and prevent certain mental illnesses by educating individuals, families, and societies. Facilitating the social inclusion of people with mental health problems is a major focus of modern social psychiatry.
