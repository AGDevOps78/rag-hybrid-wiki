Rather than a single denomination, the New Age milieu functioned as a loose market of workshops, retreats and publishing that recycled and recombined esoteric materials with psychologized self-cultivation and therapeutic language. Sociological models describe this circulation in terms of a “cultic milieu”, in which heterodox ideas—astrology, subtle-body schemes, trance techniques—persist and periodically reappear in new guises; Partridge’s notion of “occulture” further captures how such repertoires permeate popular culture beyond formal religion. In this environment, esoteric content was often translated into symbolic-psychological frames (e.g., projective counselling, human potential workshops) or packaged for wellness and coaching, while academic psychology largely followed separate methodological trajectories. Although the New Age as a self-identified movement declined as an organizational label before the end of the 20th century, scholars argue that many of its psychologized practices and narratives dispersed into broader wellness, self-help, and 'spiritual but not religious' cultures where they continue to provide idioms for meaning-making and self-work. == Schools and modalities in psychology, psychotherapy, and counselling == === Analytical psychology (Jung) === Within analytical psychology, Carl Jung developed a sustained hermeneutics of premodern symbol-systems—most prominently alchemy—as resources for theorising psychic structure, transformation and individuation. Techniques such as active imagination, dream work and the use of mandalas exemplified a translation of esoteric repertoires into psychological practice under a symbolic/interpretive framing. Comparative engagements in Jungian circles, including dialogues around classical divination corpora (notably the I Ching), normalised the use of oracular media as projective prompts in counselling and self-exploration. In this milieu, the notion of synchronicity (“an acausal connecting principle”) offered an interpretive rationale for treating draws and charts as meaningful coincidences to be worked hermeneutically rather than as divinatory proofs.
