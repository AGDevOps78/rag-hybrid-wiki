One study found that on average people in love spent 65% of their waking hours thinking of their loved one. Studies by Bianca Acevedo & Arthur Aron found that the obsessional component of the PLS can be separated from the non-obsessional component. Items on the PLS measuring obsession are, for example, "Sometimes I feel I can't control my thoughts; they are obsessively on my partner", "I sometimes find it difficult to concentrate on work because thoughts of my partner occupy my mind" and "I get extremely depressed when things don't go right in my relationship with my partner."

These authors (Acevedo & Aron, Graham) have speculated that continued romantic obsession within a relationship could be connected to attachment style. Attachment style refers to differences in attachment-related thoughts and behaviors, especially relating to the concept of security vs.
