Those who work with dangerous organisms or toxic substances in the laboratory must follow strict safety procedures to avoid contamination. Many biological scientists, such as botanists, ecologists, and zoologists, conduct field studies that involve strenuous physical activity and primitive living conditions. Biological scientists in the field may work in warm or cold climates, in all kinds of weather. == Honors and awards == The highest honor awarded to biologists is the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, awarded since 1901, by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Other significant awards include the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences (established in 1980), and the Maxwell/Hanrahan Award in Field Biology (established in 2020). == See also == Biology Glossary of biology List of biologists Lists of biologists by author abbreviation == References == U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook
