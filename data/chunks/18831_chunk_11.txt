Topology, the study of properties that are kept under continuous deformations. Algebraic topology, the use in topology of algebraic methods, mainly homological algebra. Discrete geometry, the study of finite configurations in geometry. Convex geometry, the study of convex sets, which takes its importance from its applications in optimization. Complex geometry, the geometry obtained by replacing real numbers with complex numbers. === Algebra === Algebra is the art of manipulating equations and formulas. Diophantus (3rd century) and al-Khwarizmi (9th century) were the two main precursors of algebra. Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution.
