Likewise, family constellations circulate in coaching and group-work settings with strong dramaturgic elements; reviews highlight mixed evidence and methodological concerns, advising caution and clear framing when used in para-clinical contexts. Some masculinity coaching and men’s-group ecologies drew selectively on Jungian archetypal vocabularies and, in some milieus, on neo-tantric, neidan, or polarity of “energy” (Sulphur or Sun-masculine/Mercury or Moon-femenine from alchemy, Shiva/Shakti, yin and yang) rhetorics, illustrating how symbolic repertoires are operationalised in advice genres outside formal clinical frameworks. Across these formats, the article maintains an analytic distinction between provenance (genealogical links to esoteric repertoires) and evidence (empirical appraisal of outcomes). Symbolic/interpretive framings—sometimes glossed as “as-if real”—are reported with attribution and kept distinct from realist–occult assertions; cultural visibility in wellness and coaching markets does not constitute clinical validation. Energy-labelled offerings (e.g., reiki-style sessions in coaching or as complementary add-ons) likewise illustrate how subtle-body vocabularies circulate in para-clinical niches; historians frame these under occulture/market diffusion rather than academic psychology. == Esoteric-linked mental health hospitals == In Brazil, Kardecist spiritism (a French origins branch of Spiritualism) developed durable interfaces with mental-health provision through Spiritist psychiatric hospitals that combine conventional psychiatric care with complementary Spiritist practices (e.g., “passes”, mediumistic counselling). Historical and clinical overviews document this model as emerging in the early–mid twentieth century and concentrated in Brazil; surveys describe operating structures, staffing and modalities of care across leading centres. In this article such institutions are treated as regional institutionalizations of an esoteric repertoire within modern healthcare systems; genealogical description is kept distinct from evidential claims about clinical outcomes.
