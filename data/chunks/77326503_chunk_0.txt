Negative air ions (NAI) are negatively charged single gas molecules or ion clusters in the air. They play a role in maintaining the charge balance of the atmosphere. The main components of air are molecular nitrogen and oxygen. Due to the strong electronegativity of oxygen and oxygen-containing molecules, they can easily capture electrons to form negatively charged air ions, most of which are superoxide radicals ·O2−, so NAI are mainly composed of negative oxygen ions, also called air negative oxygen ions. The ions can be produced by natural means such as lightning, or artificially by methods such as a corona discharge. They can play a role in electrostatic removal of air particulates both for industrial applications and with indoor air, and there are claims that they have a beneficial health effect although the evidence for this is weak. == Generation mechanism == Various negative air ions are formed by combining active neutral molecules and electrons in the gas through a series of ion-molecule reactions. In the air, due to the presence of many water molecules, the negative air ions typically combine with water to form hydrated negative air ions, such as O−·(H2O)n, O2−·(H2O)n, O3−·(H2O)n, OH−·(H2O)n, CO3−·(H2O)n, HCO3−·(H2O)n, CO4−·(H2O)n, NO2−·(H2O)n, NO3−·(H2O)n, etc.
