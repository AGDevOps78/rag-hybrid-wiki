=== Arts-based psychotherapies and counselling === ==== Ritual movement and dramatization ==== Ritualised and dramatic formats—ranging from structured openings and closures to role-work, gesture, and symbolic sequencing—translate esoteric dramaturgies into educational, humanistic, and para-clinical settings oriented toward self-insight and emotional regulation. In workshop and counselling circuits influenced by humanistic and transpersonal psychology, the emphasis falls on containment, process, and symbolic rehearsal rather than on doctrinal belief, illustrating how ritual and theatrical devices were reframed as psychological techniques. Early twentieth-century reformers such as George Gurdjieff and Rudolf Steiner developed choreographed repertoires—Gurdjieff’s "Movements" and Steiner’s Eurythmy—that integrated posture, rhythm, and spatial design to enact metaphysical correspondences and cultivate heightened awareness. These practices functioned as embodied exercises of esoteric self-transformation, combining ritual, theatre, and psychophysical discipline. Later adaptations recontextualised their techniques for pedagogical and therapeutic use under symbolic (non-realist) descriptions, creating points of translation between spiritual choreography and psychological process work. From the mid-twentieth century onward, a constellation of expressive and creative psychotherapies—such as psychodrama, dance/movement therapy, and related experiential group practices—expanded this performative lineage. Drawing variously on Jungian symbolism, Reichian somatic therapy, and the holistic philosophy of humanistic and transpersonal psychology, their founders framed movement, voice, and enactment as means of catharsis, integration, and energetic balance. Although later professionalised in clinical and educational contexts, historians of psychology trace their conceptual origins to the spiritual humanism and vitalist cosmologies that characterised the broader Western esoteric revival.
