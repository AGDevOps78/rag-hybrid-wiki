Much of the work of marine biology centers on molecular biology, the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biology is a branch of oceanography, which is the study of the biological, chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor. (See the Handbook statements on environmental scientists and hydrologists and on geoscientists.) Paleontologists study the history of life on Earth through the analysis of fossils—preserved remains, traces, or impressions of past organisms found within rocks. Their work combines biological knowledge with geological methods, since interpreting fossils requires understanding the stratigraphy, sedimentology, and geochronology of the rock layers in which they occur. Paleontologists reconstruct ancient organisms, ecosystems, and environments; investigate patterns of evolution, extinction, and biodiversity through deep time; and analyze how geological processes influence the preservation and distribution of fossils. Many specialize in particular groups, such as vertebrates, invertebrates, or plants, or in subfields such as taphonomy (the study of fossilization), paleoecology (ancient ecosystems), or biostratigraphy (dating and correlating rock layers using fossils). Evolutionary biologists investigate the evolutionary processes that produced the diversity of life on Earth, starting from a single common ancestor. These processes include natural selection, common descent, and speciation.
