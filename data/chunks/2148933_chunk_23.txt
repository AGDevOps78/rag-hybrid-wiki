This study laid the foundation for future research on social determinants of mental health and legitimized the role of social science methods in psychiatric research. It also influenced public health policies over the next few decades, including the war on poverty and the community health movements. ==== Hollingshead and Redlich's New Haven study (1958) ==== Social Class and Mental Illness was a collaboration between psychiatrist Frederick Redlich and sociologist August Hollingshead. It explored the relationship between social class and mental illness in New Haven, Connecticut, focusing on disparities in access to and types of mental health care. Using a classification system that divided participants into five social classes, Hollingshead and Redlich analyzed patterns of mental illness diagnoses, treatment settings, and care quality. They found that individuals in lower social classes experienced higher rates of mental illness but were more likely to receive custodial care, while those in upper classes accessed psychotherapy and higher-quality treatments. By highlighting the systemic inequities in mental health care based on social class, this study contributed to social psychiatry by emphasizing the need for equitable mental health services and policy reform to reduce inequities in psychiatric care. ==== Midtown Manhattan study (1962) ==== Mental Health in the Metropolis, published in 1962, was one of the earliest urban studies to systematically document the social factors of mental health.
