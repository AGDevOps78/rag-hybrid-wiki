The light exposure conditions also play a role, with an exponential dependence on the illumination intensity. Bioreactor have been explored which can produce levels of ions that could be useful for reducing particular contaminants. === Artificial ionization === ==== Corona discharge method ==== Currently, the most common artificial method is to use corona discharge to produce negative ions. The specific process of using corona discharge to produce gaseous negative ions is to connect the high-voltage negative electrode to a thin needle-shaped wire or a conductor with a very small radius of curvature, so that a strong electric field is generated near the electrode, releasing electrons. The electrons to collide with gas molecules, and produce new free electrons and positive ions. The newly generated free electrons will repeat the previous process, and this process will be repeated. ==== The water vapour method ==== The water vapour method refers to the use of artificial technology and modern instruments to simulate the process of charging via the waterfall effect, using high-speed airflow to collide with water droplets, dispersing larger water droplets into a large number of microdroplets. As the water droplet dispersion occurs, the Leonard effect is active, generating negative ions.
