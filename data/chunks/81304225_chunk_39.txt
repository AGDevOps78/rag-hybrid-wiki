Genealogical links to esoteric repertoires do not in themselves predict outcomes; conversely, cultural visibility in wellness or coaching markets does not constitute clinical validation. Reviews at the psychology–religion interface therefore recommend keeping source-tracing distinct from empirical appraisal and maintaining clarity between symbolic/interpretive framings and realist–occult assertions. Reported benefits—when present—are frequently interpreted in terms of common factors and meaning responses in structured settings (working alliance, expectancy, ritual sequence, symbolic media, group containment). In personality typing, the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)—inspired by Jungian typology—has seen widespread uptake in education and management while attracting sustained criticism concerning reliability, temporal stability of “types” and predictive validity; overviews recommend caution regarding its use for selection or diagnosis. By contrast, the modern Enneagram emerged from late twentieth-century esoteric–therapeutic milieus (e.g., Óscar Ichazo; later adaptations by Claudio Naranjo) before diffusing into counselling and coaching; academic surveys emphasise its recent provenance, heterogeneous evidence base and cultural vigency rather than established efficacy. Communication-focused packages commonly grouped under NLP circulate in coaching and health-adjacent contexts; systematic reviews have reported insufficient evidence for robust effects and pervasive methodological limitations. Energy-labelled offerings (reiki-style sessions, “healing touch”, pranic variants) sit at the boundary of the field: critics question proposed subtle-energy mechanisms and call for higher-quality trials, while proponents and detractors dispute both mechanisms and effect sizes; the article therefore reports such practices as diffusion phenomena (occulture/workshop economies) and urges explicit separation between complementary uses and clinical claims. Boundary-field literatures such as parapsychology—evolving from nineteenth-century psychical research into laboratory and survey programmes on anomalous cognition (e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance)—are treated here as historical interfaces with psychology rather than as psychological schools; claims are reported with attribution and kept analytically distinct from genealogical description and from clinical efficacy appraisals.
