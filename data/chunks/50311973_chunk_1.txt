== Fabrication == Some considerations for microfluidic devices relating to cell culture include: fabrication material (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polystyrene) culture region geometry control system for delivering and removing media when needed using either passive methods (e.g., gravity-driven flow, capillary pumps, or Laplace pressure based 'passive pumping') or a flow-rate controlled device (i.e., perfusion system) Fabrication material is crucial as not all polymers are biocompatible, with some materials such as PDMS causing undesirable adsorption or absorption of small molecules. Additionally, uncured PDMS oligomers can leach into the cell culture media, which can harm the microenvironment. As an alternative to commonly used PDMS, there have been advances in the use of thermoplastics (e.g., polystyrene) as a replacement material. Spatial organization of cells in microscale devices largely depends on the culture region geometry for cells to perform functions in vivo. For example, long, narrow channels may be desired to culture neurons. The perfusion system chosen might also affect the geometry chosen. For example, in a system that incorporates syringe pumps, channels for perfusion inlet, perfusion outlet, waste, and cell loading would need to be added for the cell culture maintenance. Perfusion in microfluidic cell culture is important to enable long culture periods on-chip and cell differentiation.
