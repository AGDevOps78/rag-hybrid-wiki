These systemic changes aim to address the root causes of mental health disparities and improve overall population mental health. ==== Gender ==== Epidemiological studies have consistently found that women experience more mental health disorders compared to men. Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and eating disorders are among the mental health disorders women experience at a higher frequency than men. The American Psychiatric Association attributes some of these to higher social risk factors. Women experience more poverty compared to men, they are more likely to be victims of violence, and they earn less income than men. === The Stress-Vulnerability Model === The Stress-Vulnerability Model explains the development and progression of mental health disorders as a result of an interaction between an individual's biological or psychological vulnerabilities and external stressors. Vulnerabilities can include genetic predispositions, neurobiological abnormalities, or personality traits, while stressors refer to environmental and social factors such as trauma, poverty, discrimination, or interpersonal conflict. The model outlines how mental health problems progress to full-blown disorders when stressors exceed an individual's coping resources and resilience.
