Participants who were not in a relationship scored the highest on infatuation. The word "infatuation" is also sometimes used colloquially in contrast with "love", but Elaine Hatfield has argued that the only difference between infatuation (in this sense) and passionate love is semantic. Albert Ellis and Robert Harper conducted interviews and concluded that the only difference is that people use the word "infatuation" in hindsight to refer to a relationship after it ends and "love" to refer to a relationship still in progress. Hatfield suggests that when parents and friends say somebody is "just infatuated" they're just saying they don't approve of the relationship. === Obsession === Passionate love is described as having an obsessional element characterized by intrusive thinking, uncertainty, and mood swings. Intrusive thinking (or obsessive thinking) is a component of early-stage romantic love. One study found that on average people in love spent 65% of their waking hours thinking of their loved one. Studies by Bianca Acevedo & Arthur Aron found that the obsessional component of the PLS can be separated from the non-obsessional component.
