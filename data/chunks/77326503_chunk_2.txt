Natural methods can produce a large number of negative air ions. The artificial means of producing negative air ions include corona discharge and water vapour. Compared with the negative air ions produced in nature, although artificial methods can produce high levels of negative air ions, there are differences in the types and concentrations of negative air ions. === Natural environments === ==== Waterfall method ==== The mechanism of producing negative air ions by the waterfall method connects to the generation of static electricity due to water droplets hitting surfaces, first discovered by Philipp Lenard in 1892 and now called the spray electrification or waterfall effect. Falling water generates static electricity either by collisions between water drops or with the ground, leading to the finer mist in updrafts being mainly negatively charged, with positive near the lower surface. It can also occur for sliding drops. The experimental fact that charging occurs is very well documented, although details of the exact process remain a topic of debate. High speed video observations show how water spray can breakup into different droplets.
