By framing psychiatric disorders as dynamic processes influenced by life events and social interactions, psychobiology inspired approaches that consider patients within their broader environment. This influenced later theories, including Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal theory and the study of social determinants of health. It also reinforced the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between psychiatry and sociology, anthropology, and public health. === Interpersonal theory === Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal theory emphasizes the role of interpersonal relationships in shaping personality development and mental health, arguing that individuals' personalities are formed and expressed within the context of their social interactions. In his book The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry (1955), Sullivan argued that psychiatric disorders are best understood through interpersonal interactions, not just internal conflicts. By integrating social and cultural influences with biological and intra-psychic models, Sullivan believed it was crucial to examine societal structures and interpersonal systems in order to address mental health challenges. Sullivan proposed that personality develops through relationships and that disruptions in these interactions often underlie psychological distress. He introduced the idea that the "self" is shaped by social experiences and outlined a developmental framework linking psychological well-being to navigating interpersonal challenges at different life stages, such as trust in infancy and intimacy in adolescence.
