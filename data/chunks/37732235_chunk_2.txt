These forces are easily experienced when hands are washed with soap. Adsorbing soap molecules make the skin negatively charged, and the slippery feeling is caused by the strongly repulsive double layer forces. These forces are further relevant in many colloidal or biological systems, and may be responsible for their stability, formation of colloidal crystals, or their rheological properties. == Poisson–Boltzmann model == The most popular model to describe the electrical double layer is the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model. This model can be equally used to evaluate double layer forces. Let us discuss this model in the case of planar geometry as shown in the figure on the right. In this case, the electrical potential profile ψ(z) near a charged interface will only depend on the position z. The corresponding Poisson's equation reads in SI units d 2 ψ d z 2 = − ρ ε 0 ε {\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\psi }{dz^{2}}}=-{\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0}\epsilon }}} where ρ is the charge density per unit volume, ε0 the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum, and ε the dielectric constant of the liquid.
