Sullivan proposed that personality develops through relationships and that disruptions in these interactions often underlie psychological distress. He introduced the idea that the "self" is shaped by social experiences and outlined a developmental framework linking psychological well-being to navigating interpersonal challenges at different life stages, such as trust in infancy and intimacy in adolescence. Interpersonal theory helped advance social psychiatry by emphasizing the significance of social and interpersonal factors in mental health, shifting the focus from purely biological explanations to a more holistic understanding of mental illness. By incorporating interpersonal dynamics and social influences into psychiatric theory, Sullivan shifted the field toward a more holistic understanding of mental health, paving the way for innovations such as family therapy, community mental health programs, and the exploration of social determinants of health. === Biopsychosocial model === The biopsychosocial model, developed by George Engel in 1977, integrates biological, psychological, and social factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of mental health. Social psychiatry builds on this framework to design interventions around community-based care and mental illness prevention. === Social determinants of mental health === Social psychiatry emphasizes how different societal and environmental factors influence mental health and contribute to psychiatric disorders. Below are some of the core factors the field has identified.
