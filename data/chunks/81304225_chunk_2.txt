Purely devotional mysticism (union without operative correspondences) is distinguished from esotericism; by contrast, secular mind–body programmes without esoteric genealogy (e.g., standardized MBSR) are treated as contrasts rather than instances. === Methodological cautions === Consistent with the academic study of Western esotericism, the article distinguishes actors’ emic self-descriptions from scholarly etic analysis. To avoid false positives, resemblance alone does not warrant claims of influence: at least one of the following is required—(a) explicit self-attribution by the actors, (b) operational adoption of symbols/diagrams/rites as method, or (c) a traceable chain of transmission (people, texts, institutions) consistent with Faivre’s components. In addition, the article separates realist–occult claims from a symbolic/interpretive framing—sometimes glossed informally, once here, as “as-if real”—in which images, diagrams, rites or oracles function as structured prompts for meaning-making rather than as vehicles of literal knowledge. === Analytical framework used in this article === For descriptive clarity, each case is characterised along four axes: (1) episteme (realist–occult; symbolic/interpretive; secular–therapeutic), (2) frame (ritual/doctrinal or clinical/educational), (3) purpose (gnosis/unio; psychic integration; symptom relief; optimization), and (4) device (symbolic tools such as tarot, astrology or I Ching; trance/hypnosis/breathwork; somatic work; ritual/drama; textual formulas). Statements about efficacy are reported separately using broad bands (A = controlled trials or systematic reviews; B = observational or case-series evidence; C = testimonials or mixed/weak findings). These tags are heuristic and remain distinct from genealogical claims or value judgements. == Historiography and frameworks == Modern scholarship generally treats Faivre’s componential definition as a heuristic grid rather than as an ontology for what esotericism “is”.
