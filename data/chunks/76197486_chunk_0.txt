Shockwave cosmology is a non-standard cosmology proposed by Joel Smoller and Blake Temple in 2003. In this model, the “big bang” is an explosion inside a black hole, producing the expanding volume of space and matter that includes the observable universe. == Integration with general relativity == Smoller and Temple integrate shock waves into Einstein's general relativity. This produces a universe that "looks essentially identical to the aftermath of the big bang" according to cosmologists Barnes and Lewis. They explain that Smoller and Temple's version is distinguished from the big bang only by there being a shockwave at the leading edge of an explosion – one that, for Smoller and Temple's model, must be beyond the observable universe. However, Barnes and Lewis do not support shockwave cosmology because they see it as not testable; they point out that there is no explosion in the standard theory of the Big Bang. == Current and future state of the universe == From Smoller and Temple's calculations, we are still inside an expanding black hole. The configuration of 'flat' spacetime (see Minkowski space) inside a black hole, also occurs during the moments of the formation of a black hole from a collapsing star.
