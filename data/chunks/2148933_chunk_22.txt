L. Faris and H. Warren Dunham aimed to examine the relationship between urban environmental factors and rates of mental illness, particularly schizophrenia. Using psychiatric hospital admission records in Chicago, they mapped the distribution of schizophrenia and other psychoses across different neighborhoods, correlating mental illness prevalence with socioeconomic conditions. They found higher rates of schizophrenia in areas with significant poverty, high population turnover, and social disintegration, particularly in inner-city neighborhoods. Mental illness rates decreased as neighborhoods became more stable and affluent. This study laid the foundation for future research on social determinants of mental health and legitimized the role of social science methods in psychiatric research. It also influenced public health policies over the next few decades, including the war on poverty and the community health movements.
