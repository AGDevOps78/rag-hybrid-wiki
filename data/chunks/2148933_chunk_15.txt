==== Race and ethnicity ==== Social psychiatrists have done research on how race and ethnicity influences mental health, particularly in the context of systemic racism, migration, immigration, and globalization. Experiences of discrimination and institutional bias in areas like housing, employment, and healthcare contribute to chronic stress and poorer mental health outcomes for marginalized racial groups. Immigrants and racial minorities may also face acculturation stress and identity conflicts, further affecting their mental well-being. However, some communities develop strong cultural or social bonds that act as protective factors against the effects of racism, a key area of interest in social psychiatry. Racial disparities in mental health care access, often influenced by cultural stigma, exacerbate untreated conditions and highlight the need for culturally informed interventions. Social psychiatry leverages these insights to advocate for policies that promote housing security, equitable education, anti-discrimination measures, and economic redistribution. These systemic changes aim to address the root causes of mental health disparities and improve overall population mental health. ==== Gender ==== Epidemiological studies have consistently found that women experience more mental health disorders compared to men.
