Writers such as Annie Payson Call taught guided relaxation and posture–breath discipline for “nerves” and self-regulation in non-clinical settings, combining moral reform with bodily awareness (see relaxation techniques, guided imagery). Her work, including Power Through Repose (1891), translated the harmonial and mind-cure milieux—shaped in part by Swedenborgianism, mesmerism and American metaphysical religion—into a psychophysical programme of self-culture. Historian Mark Singleton characterises her method (analytically) as “salvation through relaxation”, and argues that its emphasis on proprioceptive awareness and repose prefigured twentieth-century relaxation therapies and fed into Western receptions of “yoga-like” breath and relaxation practices. In this sense, Call exemplifies how harmonial religion prefigured the modern psychologization of esoteric ideas about inner harmony and divine influx. Historians also note that the “breath culture” repertoire systematized by William Walker Atkinson (as “Yogi Ramacharaka”) drew largely on Western hygienic and psychological currents subsequently reframed in Indic vocabulary; scholarship interprets this as a case of Western re-signification rather than direct transmission from South Asian sources. In parallel, the Mazdaznan movement propagated a “religion of breathing” that blended Theosophical, neo-Zoroastrian and popular psychophysiological motifs, illustrating early esoteric reinterpretations of respiratory discipline within the American harmonial field. Among late-1960s self-help and human potential offerings, José Silva’s Silva Method (originally “Silva Mind Control”) packaged relaxation/auto-hypnosis and guided imagery— including exercises with “inner guides” (imaginal counselors)—together with the era’s alpha-training discourse and New Thought-style autosuggestion, while also invoking elements of ESP in a parapsychological key. Reference works place the program in the self-religion/auto-help milieu rather than clinical psychotherapy and note Silva’s autodidactic background (psychology, yoga, modern Rosicrucian doctrines) and the model’s international diffusion via seminars and books.
