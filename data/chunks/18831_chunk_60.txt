Presenting mathematics may be hard since the general public suffers from mathematical anxiety and mathematical objects are highly abstract. However, popular mathematics writing can overcome this by using applications or cultural links. Despite this, mathematics is rarely the topic of popularization in printed or televised media. === Awards and prize problems === The most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields Medal, established by Canadian John Charles Fields in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to up to four individuals. It is considered the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Other prestigious mathematics awards include: The Abel Prize, instituted in 2002 and first awarded in 2003 The Chern Medal for lifetime achievement, introduced in 2009 and first awarded in 2010 The AMS Leroy P. Steele Prize, awarded since 1970 The Wolf Prize in Mathematics, also for lifetime achievement, instituted in 1978 A famous list of 23 open problems, called "Hilbert's problems", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician David Hilbert. This list has achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least thirteen of the problems (depending how some are interpreted) have been solved.
