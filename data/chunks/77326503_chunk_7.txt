==== The water vapour method ==== The water vapour method refers to the use of artificial technology and modern instruments to simulate the process of charging via the waterfall effect, using high-speed airflow to collide with water droplets, dispersing larger water droplets into a large number of microdroplets. As the water droplet dispersion occurs, the Leonard effect is active, generating negative ions. The air moving past the water droplets may also lead to triboelectric charging, similar to aircraft "precipitation static" or "P-static"; aircraft typically have one or more static wicks to remove this. == Detection == Detection of negative air ions is divided into measurement and identification. NAI measurement can be achieved by measuring the change in atmospheric conductivity when NAI pass through a conductive tube. NAI identification is typically performed by mass spectrometry, which can effectively identify a variety of negative ions, including O−,O2−,O3−,CO3−,HCO3−,NO3−, etc. == Application of negative air ions == === Environmental improvement === Negative air ions are a component of electrostatic filters which are used to remove dust and particulate pollutants (PM) both in industry and for indoor pollutants. One area that has been studied is the use of a corona-negative ions generator in experiments on particles sedimentation through three steps: charging, migration, and sedimentation.
